### Decisions ###
SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle:0 "Preparations for the War of Unification"
SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle_desc:0 "For years we have waited for the opportunity to unite the Arabian peninsula under the House of Saud. Sadly the Ottoman watchdogs did not sleep with both eyes closed and when the British Empire fell in 1925, they more than rewarded their Rashidi lapdogs for their "loyalty" during the Weltkrieg. As we were left with nothing, devoid of allies and territorial gains, Abdulaziz grew ever more restless and vengeful.\n\nSaud bin Abd Al-Aziz may be enjoying the support of his Ottoman allies but dark clouds are gathering on the horizon and should his powerful benefactor find himself occupied in internal matters, his pathethic armies will have the face the Ikhwans rage all on their own..."

Zealous religious warriors, they are not bound by loyalty to Ibn Saud but by allegiance to the strict morals of Islamic society. Renouncing all Western advances, the Ikwhan wish to purify the Islamic world of its decadence and unite all muslims in a single unitary state.\n\nNonetheless they are an unruly and barbaric force, slitting the throats of all male prisoners they encounter and fighting with swords and lances. This makes them a worthy asset however to Ibn Saud as their zealously and bloodthirstiness is used in their infamous raids on the territories of our neighbours."

### Events ###

saud.1.t:0 "The Emirate of Nejd"
saud.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined the rule this land. In the hour of his greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks and their puppet masters. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks hold no real sway over us. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the Rashidis, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!"

### Events ###

saud.150.d:0 "The Ikhwan has been a strong army presence in Arabia for decades. They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert Saudi dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the Saudis are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."

The first, including the Rashidis, Hashimite, Al Thani and Howietat were deemed too rebellious to be loyal vassals to Nejd. The latter, including the Al Nahyan and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alligence to the Saudi Arabia. This new form of vassalage is different from the ruthless precedence Ibn Saud's forefathers operated on, and are protected from the Ikhwan in perpetuity. "
saud.151.a:0 "Sufficient is Allah as our ally"

saud.152.t:0 "Ikhwan Revolt Defeated"
saud.152.d:0 "The Ikhwan have finally been defeated, and the last of their soldiers are currently being rounded up."
saud.152.a:0 "Good riddance!"
