### Events ###

fop.1.t:0 "The Frente Obrero Patagónico"
fop.1.d:0 "Argentina was in a state of chaos during the Weltkrieg, with British companies exploiting its people and resources to get everything they could for the war. This led to unrest throughout the nation, especially in the south of the country in Patagonia. Extremely poor working conditions brought the rise of socialism and syndicalism, with thousands of people refusing to work and rioting through the streets. The British forced the Argentine government to intervene, turning riots into rebellion. When no real agreement could be made, the Frente Obrero Patagónico was born.\n\nMany years later, the fires of revolution continue to burn in Patagonia. Chile stepped in and protect us from the north, and holds much sway in how our nation is governed. Antonio Soto, leader of FORA and one of the main participants in the revolution, has lead the nation ever since. Due to political instability, proper elections have not yet been held, however Soto promises that there will be an election in 1938 to confirm the people's choice for head of state. There are worries that the election won't take place in time, due to the rise of Carlés in the north, people fear that an invasion will happen. If we are not prepared we will be destroyed. However, if we succeed, we can move to spread the greatness of socialism to all of South America!"
fop.1.a:0 "Viva la Revolution!"
fop.2.t:0 "The FOP Calls for Chilean Volunteers"
fop.2.d:0 "We have just received word from our neighbours in Patagonia that they are requesting we send them volunteers for their upcoming war against the core Argentine government. We have promised that we will aid them in their future war, and they are our chance to defeat the Argentine menace."
fop.2.a:0 "Send them volunteers."
fop.2.b:0 "What benefit do we gain? Refuse them."
fop.3.t:0 "Chile Sends Volunteers"
fop.3.d:0 "Chile has decided to send us volunteers to help us in our upcoming war against Argentina."
fop.3.a:0 "Their forces will be valued greatly."
fop.4.t:0 "Chile Refuses to Send Volunteers"
fop.4.d:0 "Although claiming to be our ally, Chile have refused to send us any volunteers to train our forces before war breaks out."
fop.4.a:0 "We will not forget this."
fop.5.t:0 "The FOP Requests Manpower"
fop.5.d:0 "The Workers Front of Patagonia, known as the FOP, has requested that we aid their struggle by sending them manpower and equipment. Soon they will face war with the Argentine government, and they need to be prepared for when it happens. If they succeed, they can become a permanent foothold of Syndicalism in South America."
fop.5.a:0 "We will send men and guns."
fop.5.b:0 "We will only send men."
fop.5.c:0 "South America is too far away..."
fop.6.t:0 "The Hannaford Idea"
fop.6.d:0 "Guillermo Mac Hannaford is an ex-army major of the Argentinian military. During the events of the Christmas Coup, he was accused of handing over secret documents to Paraguay and other enemy nations, and was thrown in prison.\n\nToday, one of our officers approached us with an idea. The prison he is being held in is rather close to the border. The officer stated that we could send a small force across the border secretly, and attempt to break him out of prison and bring him to us. When here, he could help our army be more effective in our upcoming war. Although it sounds like a great idea, it does come with many risks."
fop.6.a:0 "Go through with the plan."
fop.6.b:0 "Thats a ridiculous idea!"
fop.7.t:0 "Hannaford made it out Alive"
fop.7.d:0 "Our mission was a great success, with us successfully getting Hannaford out of prison alive, as well as most of our troops. It was truly a military success."
fop.7.a:0 "Excellent."
fop.8.t:0 "Hannaford Died but our Troops Escaped"
fop.8.d:0 "While sieging the prison Hannaford was trapped in, he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. However, most of our troops got out alive, and it is always good training for the future."
fop.8.a:0 "That's not terrible."
fop.9.t:0 "Major Mission Failure"
fop.9.d:0 "The mission failed massively, with Hannaford dying and most of our troops being lost in the escape."
fop.9.a:0 "Damn."
fop.10.t:0 "Hannaford is Refusing to Help"
fop.10.d:0 "We successfully got Hannaford out of prison alive, but there is still a problem. He is currently refusing to aid our nation, but may be swayed with some appropriate bribes..."
fop.10.a:0 "Let's try to bribe him."
fop.10.b:0 "He's more trouble than he's worth. Exile him."
fop.11.t:0 "Hannaford has Accepted the Bribe"
fop.11.d:0 "Hannaford has accepted our bribe and agreed to work with us. Although it would've been better if he had just helped us from the start, this will still benefit us."
fop.11.a:0 "That's good enough."
fop.12.t:0 "Hannaford Refused the Bribe"
fop.12.d:0 "Although we have tried to bribe him, he has refused anything we offer. We don't really have a choice other than to exile him."
fop.12.a:0 "Well that was all useless."
fop.13.t:0 "Argentina Wants Independence"
fop.13.d:0 "Argentina, previously the FOP, has been under our protection and influence since its inception. Now, after the defeat of Carlés, they see that it is prime time for them to become fully independent. However, they agree to keep strong ties with us and will remain our ally. If we refuse their deal, they may attempt independence through force."
fop.13.a:0 "Allow independence."
fop.13.b:0 "We cannot let them go."
fop.14.t:0 "Chile has Refused our Independence"
fop.14.d:0 "After asking Chile peacefully to allow us to become a fully independent nation, they have refused, stating that we cannot handle ourselves safely. It appears Chile is acting like the dictator we just defeated, and maybe it is time to break the chains..."
fop.14.a:0 "Break the Chilean chains holding us down!"
fop.14.b:0 "We shall remain slaves."
fop.15.t:0 "Argentina Threatens Us"
fop.15.d:0 "Argentina has sent a letter to our government, stating that they will proclaim independence in the coming days and that we cannot change that. They state that if we do not allow their independence, they will be forced to turn to more violent means."
fop.15.a:0 "Let them go."
fop.15.b:0 "We do not fear the Argentinians!"
fop.16.t:0 "Chile Refuses us Independence"
fop.16.d:0 "Chile have responded to our bid for independence, stating that they refuse to allow it. What shall we do?"
fop.16.a:0 "This changes nothing."
fop.16.b:0 "We shall remain slaves."
fop.17.t:0 "The [GetYear] Election"
fop.17.d:0 "Ever since the initial rebellion many years ago, Soto has been our de facto leader and Head of State. However, he has promised to bring an election this year, to try to promote stability. There are three options; first is Jabcovsky, our most acclaimed general and our most famous member of the military. She has wide popularity across the nation, and her industrial and military plans will boost the nation to new levels. The second option is Soto himself, one of the leaders of the revolution and a popular man with the people, who believes in peaceful solutions to our nations problems. Finally, our third choice is Baldomero. Baldomero believes in Pan-Americanism and the spread and unity of syndicalist nations."
fop.17.a:0 "Jabcovsky wins the election."
fop.17.b:0 "Soto wins the election."
fop.17.c:0 "Baldomero wins the election."
fop.18.t:0 "Officers Speak Out about Alfredo Fonte"
fop.18.d:0 "Today, some of our officers have approached us to discuss Alfredo Fonte. He lead his own forces in helping us rebel against the Argentine government, but he was always very brutal about it. He was the one who triggered the uprising when negotiations were still possible. Since then, there have always been rumours that he has been travelling the country with his band of mercenaries, raiding villages and pillaging homes. It appears these officers are here to confirm these rumours, stating that some of their troops had been raided by a group of bandits lead by Fonte. It would be too bold to just arrest him now, for technically we have not caught him doing anything illegal. Also, he did also help us with the revolution. However, we will keep an eye on him."
fop.18.a:0 "This can't be true..."
fop.19.t:0 "Fonte Captured while Raiding Farmers"
fop.19.d:0 "After recent reports that Alfredo Fonte has been raiding rural villages, we sent troops out to multiple villages to keep an eye out for any raids. Sure enough, after a few weeks, one of our regiments reported back to us, saying they stopped a raid from a band of mercenaries, headed by Alfredo Fonte. If we wanted to now, we could imprison him, or even execute him for his bad deeds. However, we must remember that he was someone who helped us through the revolution, so by imprisoning or killing him we will lose much political support."
fop.19.a:0 "He should be executed!"
fop.19.b:0 "Prison for the criminal."
fop.19.c:0 "We should just let him off with a warning."
fop.20.t:0 "Fonte caught again raiding rural villages"
fop.20.d:0 "Previously, we caught Alfredo Fonte raiding some farming village, and let him off with a warning. However, it appears he didn't even listen to our warning, for he has been caught once again raiding a rural village with his group of bandits. Surely now, it is time to bring an end to his reign of terror."
fop.20.a:0 "He must be executed!"
fop.20.b:0 "Lock him up and throw away the key!"
fop.20.c:0 "He doesn't need prison, just another warning."
fop.21.t:0 "Alfredo Fonte leads a Coup against the government!"
fop.21.d:0 "Alfredo Fonte, leader of an army of mercenaries and bandits, has marched into the capital today with his whole division there. He has declared that the current government is weak and ineffective, and without his intervention, they would fall quickly to the Argentinians. He has executed many civilians and government officials, and has sent the rest of the government into exile. The people now fear that they will suffer under Forte's dictatorship."
fop.21.a:0 "Glory to Fonte!"
fop.22.t:0 "The Argentine Commune asks us to join their faction."
fop.22.d:0 "The Argentine Commune have requested that we unite our revolutionary forces under the alliance of the Estados Socialistas de América Latina. What shall we do?"
fop.22.a:0 "Unite the revolutionaries!"
fop.22.b:0 "We can survive by ourselves."
fop.23.t:0 "Fonte breaks out of prison!"
fop.23.d:0 "Alfredo Fonte, the revolutionary turned bandit has been broken out of prison while it was under siege by the Argentine forces. He has brought back his band of mercenaries and has joined the Argentinians in fighting us! His treachery knows no bounds."
fop.23.a:0 "This is a dark time..."
fop.24.t:0 "Victory for the Revolution!"
fop.24.d:0 "Finally, after years of planning and waiting in the South, we have successfully defeated the evil government in Buenos Aires and sent them into exile. Now, we have seized the reigns of the country, and although much of the population still continues to not believe in us, they will soon. The revolution has succeeded, no longer are we trapped in Patagonia. We are now the Argentine Commune!"
fop.24.a:0 "Now for the rest of South America!"
fop.25.t:0 "The Argentine Commune demands subjugation!"
fop.25.d:0 "The Argentine Commune have demanded that we dissolve our government and become their socialist puppet state. We fear that we may not be able to defend our borders from the Syndicalist menace."
fop.25.a:0 "Let Syndicalism Rule!"
fop.25.b:0 "We can defend!"
fop.26.t:0 "Uruguay Refuses"
fop.26.d:0 "Uruguay have refused our demands to become our subject. What shall we do?"
fop.26.a:0 "It seems it is time for war."
fop.26.b:0 "We cannot afford war."
fop.27.t:0 "The Argentine Commune demands their claims"
fop.27.d:0 "While Argentina was at war with the Syndicalist Patagonia, we took it as our chance to take some of our claimed lands that they hold. However, now that the syndicalists have won, the Argentine Commune have demanded that we concede our recently acquired lands to them."
fop.27.a:0 "We cannot fight Argentina."
fop.27.b:0 "That is rightful Paraguayan land!"
fop.28.t:0 "The Argentine Commune demands their claims"
fop.28.d:0 "While Argentina was at war with the Syndicalist Patagonia, we took it as our chance to take some of our claimed lands that they hold. However, now that the syndicalists have won, the Argentine Commune have demanded that we concede our recently acquired lands to them."
fop.28.a:0 "We cannot fight Argentina."
fop.28.b:0 "That is rightful Bolivian land!"
fop.29.t:0 "Anti-socialist officers launch attack on Buenos Aires!"
fop.29.d:0 "After we were able to defeat the old Argentine government, it has been hard locating all the ex-military officers that supported the old regime. After we defeated them, many of them went into hiding, or left the country and travelled to one of our neighbours. However, it appears they have continued to be active, hiding and planning.\n\nEarlier today, a few of these officers launched an attack on Buenos Aires. With the support of ex-soldiers, and using old equipment, they moved to the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and engaged with our soldiers who were on patrol. We were forced to send in our army, and many died, both civilian and military. The soldiers even used some old artillery and damaged a nearby factory. Thankfully, we were able to defeat the rebels, and arrest the officers."
fop.29.a:0 "When will the fighting end?"
fop.30.t:0 "Riots in our major cities"
fop.30.d:0 "Although we liberated the northern population from the inequality they were ruled by, much of the population still does not support us. Today, many people took to the streets and rioted in many of our largest cities, like Mendoza, Córdoba and Buenos Aires. We successfully pacified the rioters, but force was needed, and much of the cities were damaged."
fop.30.a:0 "Damn."
fop.31.t:0 "Argentine Commune ask to join the Third Internationale"
fop.31.d:0 "The socialists and syndicalists in Patagonia were able to crush the northern reactionaries and spread syndicalism to all of Argentina. Now, they wish to join us on the world stage, for they have formally requested to join the Third Internationale. They would be a very valuable ally, due to their strength on the continent."
fop.31.a:0 "Welcome to the Internationale!"
fop.31.b:0 "We have no need for the Argentinians."
fop.32.t:0 "France accepts!"
fop.32.d:0 "France have accepted our request to join the Third Internationale. We now have strong allies all across the globe."

If we are able to properly stabilize the nation, we could see much needed peace and growth."

### Army Generals ###

FOP_Alfredo_Fonte_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1887, somewhere in Toscana, Italy.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alfredo 'El Toscano' Fonte isn't a military scholar by any stretch. His family moved to Argentina when he was three years old, and since he was a teenager he has dedicated to a life of crime. He lead a gang of anarchist bandits along with Bartolo 'El Paisano' Díaz and Florentino 'Gaucho' Cuello, with whom he raided farmsteads and small villages, attracting other bandits to his gang. During the first Patagonic strike, it was Fonte who sent the formal letter to the government in the name of the strikers, despite only taking part of the strike as an excuse for him to kidnap wealthy landlords and asking hefty sums in exchange for their lives. After the Second Patagonic Strike came about, Fonte met Micaela Feldman de Etchebéhère, who had fled to the Patagonia with his husband, and both proceeded to teach Fonte more refined strategy. Fonte has since then joined forces with Soto, and his experience leading the FOP's troops has made him a fearsome foe.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Fonte has been noted to have a psychotic and ruthless personality, which lowers the overall morale of his troops."
FOP_Fanny_Jabcovsky_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 27, 1911 in San Francisco, Córdoba, Argentina.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Fanny doesn't possess any particular military training prior to 1930. She escaped along with her husband to the FOP in 1934, joining the FOP's border guard. However, she has since then shown great tactical talent and the constant border clashes have granted her a lot of experience in guerrilla warfare as well as popularity amongs the troops.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Leader of the Communist faction of the FOP."
FOP_Paulina_Mansurova_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1915, in the Argentinean Capital, Buenos Aires City.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Born to a family of Russian Bolshevik exiles, Paulina learned from her family the crude reality of the Russian Civil War. Nevertheless, when the FOP formed, she decided to risk her life in order to help the revolution. Despite not having formal military experience, her handling of both Spanish and Russian language have facilitated communication between the military staff and many of the Russian exiles who now reside in the FOP.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- She's known to be in contact with Mikhail Frunze and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, from whom she's currently learning formal military strategy."
FOP_Marc_Augier_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 19, 1908 in Burdeaux, France.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Marc Augier was an enthusiastic alpinist before the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, in which he served in the southern Western front, near the Swiss border. With the French Syndicalist Revolution in full swing, Augier decided to leave towards Argentina, as his primitivist views clashed with the local syndicalist leaders. He has since then helped the FOP's forces with his experience as a soldier and mountaineer, quickly turning him into a celebrity and respected member of the military staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He's known to be in contact with Jacques Doriot, but he has so far refused to return to France, where he thinks his primitivist views will still clash with those of his fellow revolutionaries.\n- Alligned with Ugarte's faction"
FOP_Esteban_Lucich_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1883, in Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Esteban Lucich lacks any formal military experience, but he has become friends with the illegalist anarchist professor Germán Boris Vladimirovich, who has convinced Lucich to join the FOP's army. Since then, Lucich has proven his strategic talent, although he has proven to be cruel towards his own troops in order to reach his objectives. This attitude, however, has caught the attention of Alfredo Fonte, who approves of Lucich's approach to leadership and has promoted him to General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Lucich is known to have a psychotic and ruthless personality, which gives him a bad reputation among the FOP's populace and his troops.\n- Alligned with the anarchist faction"
FOP_Micaela_Feldman_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 14, 1902, in Moisés Ville, Santa Fe province, Argentina.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Born to a jewish family that escaped the Tsarist progroms, Mika has taken an active political role since she was 15 years old. In 1923, Mika flees to the FOP with her husband, Hipólito Etchebéhère, and meet Alfredo Fonte. With the combined effort of Mika and Hipólito, they both managed to convince Fonte to join Soto's forces and taught him what little they knew about military strategy, which they have learned from reading as a hobby during their time in the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires'. She has since then joined the FOP's army, gaining plenty of experience with the constant skirmishes along the border with Argentina. Fonte, in return for her assistance, has taught her his horse-riding techniques, becoming an excellent raider and the only officer in the FOP's staff with some talent for Cavalry tactics.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Alligned with the Communist faction."
FOP_Miguel_Arcangel_Roscigna_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1891, in Buenos Aires City, Argentina.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, inspired by the assassination of police chief Ramon L. Falcón at the hands of the anarchist Simón Radowitzky in 1909, began taking an interest in anarchism and reading anarchist literature during most of the 1910s, taking part in several anarchist groups. In 1924 he made up his mind and decided to aid Radowitzky and several anarchists to escape from the Ushuaia Penitenciary by signing up as a prison guard there. With the aid of Apolinario Barrera and the chileans Ramón Cifuentes and Ernesto Medina, they were able to organize a successful breakout and reached the FOP just as the Argentinean coastal guard was about to catch up to them. Since then Roscigna has signed up in the FOP's militias and his popularity after the breakout has led him to be chosen to lead by his own troops. However, learning about the events in the Russian Revolution, he has grown wary of the communists in the FOP, and actively works to sideline and hinder their influence.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Close friend of Radowitzky and of Buenaventura Durruti.\n- Alligned with the anarchist faction.\n- Strongly opposed to the Communist Faction."
FOP_Kurt_Gustav_Wilckens_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 3, 1886, in Bad Bramstedt, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Having studied for most of his youth to become a gardener, economic hardship forced him to enlist in the German Army in 1906 where he was assigned to the Garde Schutzen Bataillons of Prussia. When his mandatory 4 years of service were over, he travelled to the United States to learn more about gardening, and it was there where he learned about anarchism. After taking part in several strikes and industrial sabotages, he was deported back to Germany in 1920. Having learned in the US about the growing anarchist movement in Argentina, he quickly sailed once more towards the new world, arriving at Buenos Aires the 29th of September 1920. He began working in the FAUD sponsored local newspaper 'Der Syndikalist' of the German community until the Great Patagonic strikes came to be. After the initial months of near disbelief at the events, Wilckens decided to join his brothers in the south with Andrés Vázquez Paredes helping in his escape. Despite his extremely pacifist posture, he has decided to join the FOP's militia and his gentleness as well as his conviction has managed to make him rise through the ranks\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Although willing to take up arms for the anarchist ideals, Wilckens despises violence in all of its forms.\n- Alligned with the anarchist faction."
FOP_Liborio_Justo_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 6, in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. \n§YMilitary Career:§W Liborio Justo, the son of the Argentinean General Agustin P. Justo, began his military career by attending Campo de Mayo during his late adolescense, where his father was the headmaster and he began to become acquainted with the basics of military training and tactics. In 1919 he decided to join the Faculty of Medicine, where he first became involved into student movements in favour of reform. As the FOP formed in the south, Liborio travelled north, to Paraguay, abandoning his studies and becoming a factory worker and started to shape his ideological stance. Using his father's conections, he travelled to Peru during the centennial celebration of the battle of Ayacucho, meeting many important figures like Leopoldo Lugones or the American General John Pershing. With his travels having made up his mind, he decided to go to Chile next, and from there, to the FOP, where he joined one of the first communist militias that formed in the region in 1927. Since then he has taken part in several skirmishes and has trained other groups, where his previous military training have gained him huge notoriety for the revolutionary army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His writings have become widespread amongst the Communist faction, which is slowly but steadily giving him political leverage to try to contest the General Secretary post\n-His Father, Agustin, still remains as a General in the Argentinean Army and a thorn at the revolutionary side. While it is clear that Liborio is loyal to the revolution, he is still affectionate for his father, which has made the anarchists call into question his loyalty towards the revolution."
