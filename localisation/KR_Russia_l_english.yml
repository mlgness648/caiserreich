### Leaders ###
POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "The leader of the extreme nationalist and populist 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia) and its violent paramilitary organisation known as the 'Combat Squads', Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was originally a leading member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party before commandeering its rightist wing off into the NRPR. A skilled writer and demagogue, Savinkov harbours an intense hatred for the weakness of the left and holds grandiose dreams of restoring Russia to its role as the hegemon of reaction."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "An influential figure among Russian aristocrats, cousin of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II, Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich finds it very easy to manipulate the Russian political scene. A wide net of relations and acquaintances also helps him when it comes to international relationships. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_TSAR_DESC:0 "Numerous connections among the nobility, both Russian and foreign, help Emperor Dmitriy establish firm diplomatic relations with foreign courts and governments. His excellent grasp of media also gives him an advantage when it comes to establishing a positive popular image. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_PAVEL_II_DESC:0 "Only 12 at the moment of his father's death, young Pavel II is very likely to become a puppet at the hands of the regency council. Still, it is obvious that he inherited at least some of his father's charm - which, if combined with a sufficient political capacity, may someday give him a chance for independent rule."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Restored by the consensus of all political forces in Russia, Kirill Romanov had to accept many limitations of his powers, enclosed in a renewed constitution. Even though he quickly adapted to the new situation, his old-school outlook on politics and internal relations are more than likely to spark tensions between him and the government."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "With autocracy restored after two decades of republican rule, emperor Kirill is perhaps the last Romanov to uphold the traditional image of a strong, decisive autocrat. While the Russian people hope for the years of anarchy come to an end, the international arena observes the situation with suspicion, fearing a restored, possibly aggressive tsardom."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Member of the post-revolutionary generation of the Romanovs, Vladimir has a completely new outlook on the constitutionalism than his father. A tactful and temperate person, he understands that Russia may not survive yet another revolution - and is willing to cooperate with all forces aiming for the well-being of the country."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "Member of the post-revolutionary generation of the Romanovs, Vladimir has a completely new outlook on the autocracy than his father. A tactful and temperate person, he understands that Russia may not survive yet another revolution - and is willing to cooperate with all forces aiming for the well-being of the country."
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Vrangel's outlook on autocracy in Russia is simple - only with a strong rule one can protect the Empire from foes within and without. Ruthless against his enemies, Vrangel is loved by reactionaries and hated by both liberals and socialists. In international relations some perceive him as a strong man for difficult times - while others fear that one day he may become the new Gendarme of Europe."
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Anton Ivanovich Denikin was one of the more successful of the White generals during the Russian Civil War, besting both Trotsky and Makhno, before eventually capturing Moscow. Seen as a political moderate and a Kerensky loyalist given his supposed republican values and serf background, Denikin's true political motivation is pragmatic patriotism. Even though he supported Kerensky against Kolchak's attempted putsch in 1925, Anton Ivanovich has stated again and again that he will do whatever is necessary to restore and maintain Russian greatness."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Kerensky is one of the most notorious politicians in Russia, with whom the majority of the Russian population associates such events as the fall of the first Russian Republic, shameful second Brest-Litovsk peace treaty and cowardly foreign policy. However, the Russian economic boom during the NEP programme in 1925-1930, recognition of the land redistribution and recovery of the industry were also made thanks to Kerensky's internal policy. But the large political crisis of 1933-1935 has almost destroyed Kerensky's regime and even though Kerensky is approaching the fifteenth year as President of the Republic, his government barely controls the country. It is unknown if the President and his policy will maintain the order in the country or finally disappear in the past..."

russia.1.t:0 "A Troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a:0 "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1918"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1918, roughly a year after the fall of Nicholas II, the Russian constitution defines the country's political institutions. The legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate, consisting of senior nobles, statesmen, and scholars. The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."
russia.2.a:0 "The constitution guarantees freedom and stability!"

russia.2017.t:0 "The Russian Economy"
russia.2017.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War in early 1920, the Kerensky government attempted to recover the economy using a mix of socialist economic theories and the propositions of the Kadets and its supporters among the Russian capitalists. Kerensky recognised the de-facto redistribution of the land among the Russian peasants and restored private land ownership. Using the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which during the Civil War was under Kolchak's control and later was transferred to Petrograd, Kerensky introduced a new currency and launched the 'New Economic Policy', NEP, which allowed him to recover the Tsarist industry, including the military plants, and involve American investments in the various branches of the Russian economy. However the slowing growth of the economy as well as the intensification of the confrontation between the right and left parts of the Russian establishment led to the recession in 1933. It is clear that the Russian industry still has great potential, which can strengthen the economy as well as the international position of the country."
russia.2017.a:0 "We should strengthen the economy."

russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans forced us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, the Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Alexander Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Alexander Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

However, he also understands that without an efficient political programme, his control over the country will be lost and the left Social-Revolutionaries will plunge Russia into terror and chaos. The temporary prime-minister, General Lukomskiy, a well-known supporter of Kornilov can maintain a similarity of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the Senate and Duma. As a result, Kornilov has decided to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia), into the government and offer him the post of Prime-Minister. Though Savinkov and Kornilov are not on the best of terms, Kornilov hopes that Savinkov will be able to reconstruct the glory of the Russian state."

russia.37.t:0 "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
russia.37.d:0 "Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, has played a very important role in Russian politics since the end of the civil war. Between the years 1917-1920 he gained control over the rightist part of the Social-Revolutionary Party and renamed it the 'People's Republican Party of Russia', which under his leadership did its best to fight separatism throughout the country, propose radical laws to improve the position of the peasants and support pro-Russian movements in the German satrapies, carved out of the territories of the former Russian Empire by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. A talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal."

russia.38.d:0 "During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."

Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'.

Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. Although Kornilov's decision to transfer power to a civilian administration was enough keep the centrists from breaking ranks with the rightists, the fact remained that the army's heavy-handed methods of mass arrests had caused the left in the country to overwhelmingly move towards more radical parties. With any hope for reform as dead as Kerensky, it was only a matter of time before many of them took to the streets.\n\nWhat started out as riots by radicals in Petrograd and Moscow quickly gained steam as the police was unable to quell them. When the army, allegedly acting by orders from Kornilov rather than Dmitry, stepped in it only made matters worse with its heavy-handed measures. As the days went on the riots grew in intensity with more and more people siding with the reds. Despite the best efforts of the civilian government to keep things under control, the fact of the matter is that it was a government in name only. It'd barely been inaugurated and had already lost any legitimacy it may once have had with a large portion of the country's population, particularly those victimized by Kornilov's draconian measures.\n\nMere days after the riots begam to sweep the western parts of the nation, the army was forced to evacuate Dmitry and his cabinat from the capital. A provisional capital was set up in the east, and already preparations were made to fight to reclaim the western parts of the country. In the old capital, the revolutionaries that seized the moment may have done so without broad popular support, but once they were in power many regions surrounding Moscow and Petrograd soon joined ranks with them as many peasants and intellectuals alike seized the chance to gain by revolution what they could never gain through reform. Though the new socialist government is in a precarious position, it's already taking measures to mobilize militias and and rally popular support as Russia seems to be spiraling towards yet another bloody civil war."

Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. The heavy-handed approach of mass-arrests and numerous summary executions had managed to push many leftists towards more radical movements. Many liberals and even some conservatives were alienated by the drastic measures taken by the army, quickly eroding the broad support that Kornilov had in the initial days after the coup. Before long there were widespread protests in several major cities in Russia's western regions with only the army to stand against them.\n\nWhat started out as a mixture of people of all stripes voicing their dislike of Kornilov's autocratic methods quickly became dominated by the radical left, something Kornilov was all too happy to use as a justification to crack down even harder against them. As things spiraled out of control, the situation began to resemble that of 1917 more and more by the minute. What started out as soldiers disobeying orders to attack their countrymen soon spiraled into clashes between troops and Bolshevik rioters as the most radical elements on both sides took action when calmer heads seemed paralyzed by confusion and hesitance.\n\nDays after the riots began to sweep the western parts of the nation, Kornilov ordered the bulk of his forces to withdraw eastwards in order to regroup and prepare to fight back against the reds. Meanwhile in the old capital, a loose coalition of moderate socialists and and various strands of Bolsheviks had seized power and formed a shaky government. As Kornilov's authority in the west evaporated, many peasants and city-dwellers alike, many victims of the recent repression, soon joined up with the revolutionaries. Though the socialist government's situation is currently precarious at best, it has already started to mobilize militias and army deserters to take arms against Kornilov's expected counter-attack aimed at retaking the capital from the reds.

russia.1918.t:0 "Anti-Socialist Coup"
russia.1918.d:0 "When [ROOT.GetLeader] was made interim president of Russia it was with a mandate that was limited at best. The vast military apparatus of Russia was still dominated by members of the White Movement and would find someone of his background and views to be unacceptable even under the best of circumstances. The same could also be said for many civilian officials, not to mention the broad masses of Russians that were resentful of the left. When he failed to restore any semblance of order after the tragic assassination of Kerensky, it was only a matter of time before his government began to fall apart. [ROOT.GetLeader] was despised by the right from the moment he assumed office, was far too much of a socialist to be considered a compromise candidate by the liberals, and was even unable to rally Russia's left due to the utter paralysis of his administration.\n\nFearing that [ROOT.GetLeader]'s failing government would crumble and give way to a syndicalist takeover, several reactionary officers led by Lavr Kornilov made their move at the crack of dawn after weeks of preparations that had been concealed by the chaos that was reigning in Russia.  Thanks to widespread treachery within the army, intelligence services and civilian institutions they were able to seize multiple key government buildings and strategic infrastructure both in the capital and across the country before [ROOT.GetLeader]'s loyalists could put up any meaningful resistance. In a radio address heard from Smolensk in the west all the way to Kamchatka in the east, Kornilov declared that the age of anarchy was over and that the army had once more come to liberate Russia from the reds.\n\nBy noon, the interim government swept in after Kerensky's death was no more. [ROOT.GetLeader] was placed under arrest and garrisons in several major cities were rounding up and detaining prominent leftist politicians and supporters. While many Russian conservatives, nationalists and even some liberals alike were cheering on the developments, others watched in horror as Kornilov killed any hope of political reform, let alone a non-violent revolution. No matter how Kornilov acted from here on, there was little doubt to anyone in Russia or abroad that this was not the end of the nation's troubles.\n\nFor now, though, Kornilov and his closest aides had to decide how Russia would be governed after its brief stint with socialism. While he feels quite confident in both his ability to rule and the necessity of a strong hand in times such as these, close advisers to him insist that it'd be easier to win the hearts and minds of the Russian people if a friendly senate was restored and that elections (with any socialist banned, of course) were announced. The top candidate for the job of interim president is Dmitriy Romanov, an avid supporter of the counter-revolution and one of Russia's most influential rightist politicians."

russia.1949.t:0 "The Revolution Successful"
russia.1949.d.kornilov:0 "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's legitimate government he killed Russia's democracy in its infancy and signaled to millions of Russians that a return to autocracy was inevitable. As thousands were marched off to the jails, many more took to the streets to protest. Protests turned into riots, and riots then turned into a revolution. Gaining widespread popular support against the draconian measures undertaken by the Kornilov junta, the revolutionaries ranks quickly swelled. With only the most strident rightists remaining in Kornilov's fold, the hardened and veteran White Army soon found itself pushed back by the vast numbers of the reconstituted Red Army. In the end, with only Siberia to retreat towards, they eventually fragmented. Though holdouts will likely remain past the Urals for quite some time, the White Movement has been thoroughly defeated and stands no chance of reversing its fortunes.\n\nThough the vanguard of the revolution was initially sidelined by more moderate elements that joined up simply to stand up against the prospect of a stratocracy, there's no doubt that this is a victory won by the radical socialists. No matter what path the fledgling Russian Socialist Republic takes after this, she will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a socialist Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."
russia.1949.d.dmitriy:0 "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's socialist government, he seemed to be aware of the possible ramifications of assuming power all by himself. As such, he was quick to announce the transition of power from the military to the rightist forces in the Senate. Despite this however, the act of overthrowing what many still saw as Russia's legitimate government served to radicalize millions and sway them towards radical socialism. Made out of a revolutionary vanguard, their revolution spread quickly in the western parts of Russia despite lacking much in the way of widespread popular support at first. As it started to rack up victories against the White Movement, however, the revolutionary vanguard took control over one city after another from the fledgling democracy. In the end, the radical socialists managed to push them into Siberia and once their last major fallback capital fell, the movement evaporated. Though disorganized resistance will likely linger east of the Urals for years to come, the vanguard's victory has been achieved.\n\nMade out of a hardened core of revolutionaries, Russia is now controlled by the most radical socialists in the movement. Whether they'll remain in power or if the socialist republic moves to more orthodox interpretations of syndicalism now that the war is over remains to be seen. Whatever happens, however, Russia will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a communistic Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."
russia.1949.a:0 "Death to tyrants! Long live the Revolution!"

russia.1951.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
russia.1951.d.kornilov:0 "Today marks the end of the Second Russian Civil War, a bloody affair that started as a widespread revolt against what many perceived to be an autocratic overreach by Lavr Kornilov. Though it had widespread popular support at first, that quickly melted away as a resurgent White Movement started to rack up more and more victories against the 'socialist menace'. As the war went on, the Russian Socialist Republic slowly but surely started to lose the soft support it'd once enjoyed from more moderate elements of Russian society that were repulsed by Kornilov's power grab. By the end, only the most ideologically strident socialists remained to hold the torch of revolution against the seemingly unstoppable advances of the White Army.\n\nIn the end, the Second Russian Civil War ended much like the last one had with the defeat of the reds. What's different this time, however, is that there is no Kerenskiy, no Duma to speak of, not any other person or institution left that can oppose the White Movement. As suspected dissidents and stragglers are rounded up and the last vestiges of socialism are being erased from the few villages that still hold out, there can be no doubt that this is a victory without compromises for the military. International observers all seem to be in unanimous agreement that with the complete eradication of Russia's left and the hollowing out of the center, the country's almost inevitably going to remain a right-wing autocracy for years to come. Kornilov's vision of a firm hand to protect Russia from Bolshevism has now come to pass."
russia.1951.d.dmitriy:0 "Today marks the end of the Second Russian Civil War, a bloody affair that started out as a revolt led by a communist vanguard against a fledgling democracy that failed to get back on its feet after the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. Its promises quickly spread in the large cities in the west where years of mismanagement and Kornilov's brief draconian reign had taken their toll, but was eventually stopped dead in its tracks when Dmitriy Romanov managed to rally the rest of Russia against the far-left radicals. With most of the nation and the army eventually siding with Dmitriy's government over the socialist upstarts, the reds were eventually pushed out of their last few cities with only a few holdouts remaining in the countryside.\n\nIn the end, the Russian civil war ended much like the last one - with the defeat of the socialists and the preservation of a shaky democratic institution still in its infancy. Although initially seen by many as a stooge of the White Army, the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] is holding true to its promises that democracy will be preserved in Russia and that the people had won their freedom back against a violent revolutionary mob. Be that as it may, no one doubts that with two bloody civil wars fresh within its memory, Russia will likely remain firmly within  the rightist camp for years to come."

On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.GetCapital] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended.

[RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

We'll just have to bite the bullet on this one, tighten our belts, pay up, and tighten our belts in the coming months ahead. Needless to say, the governor that greenlit this will have some explaining to do..."

Though some of the socialist ideas are implemented in the ideology of Savinkov's party, the radical syndicalists, who have majority in some Russian regions reject the ideals of the national state. Fortunately for Savinkov, the new government has many loyalists in others circles of Russian society. Old friends of Savinkov, the famous philosopher Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy and his wife Zinaida Gippius have published an appeal to the new leaders of the country. They claim that Russia must be purified from internal enemies, who want to spread chaos and betray the national interests.

Because we don't forget about our brothers and sisters. The era of the betrayal is over. We are the Phoenix that was destroyed by the German aggressors, but was reborn. Wait for us. We will come. Russians should help Russians' - Though the expansionist plans of Savinkov cannot be realised right now, this declaration of unity of the Russian nation, strongly supported by the Vozhd of the Peasants and the Army shows that Russia won't avoid the confrontation with the German Empire anymore."

New Russia needs your help in the restoration of its might. Help your country to make it great once again. Glory to Russia and glory to its heroes. It is your country too' - The new national policy of Russia is based on the idea of the supremacy of the Russian people, but the idea of the friendship among the nations is popular as well. Savinkov has combined these two ideas to secure the interests of the Russians and the minorities, who should be loyal, but are also granted all the rights of citizenship. This recreation of the old Tsarist national policy can finally bring order and peace to the peoples of Russia."

Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour.

It is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate to use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and the NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once had both executive and legislative power and consisted of a small number of the most important Russian ministers. Membership of the SPC, known as "Verkhovniki", will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on top along with Kornilov and 3 of his old comrades from the Russian Army.

Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Felix asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."

But what we have to do is to be united against this radical Duma, filled with the national-populist and syndicalist fanatics. That's why I ask you to approve my plan of the Russian modernisation. The power of the Senate should be used as the iron fist in a velvet glove' - with these words the former Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich and now the Head of the Senate Dmitriy Romanov demanded an approval of his plan, which is called 'Nashe Delo' ('Our Deal'). According to this program, the powers of the State Duma should be limited, while the Senate will launch the reorganisation of the Russian internal policy and economy. But Dmitriy Pavlovich demands that the Senate should give him an absolute support of every his draft laws."

Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"

With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprisingly that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."

rusd.143.t:0 "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
rusd.143.d:0 "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerensky's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, but the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the Dmitriy Pavlovich's policy. There is a possible solution of this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as the historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitriy Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nicholas II and president Kerensky didn't have. Nothing can stop the Duke from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"

rusd.146.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitriy Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
rusd.146.a:0 "Oh well."

rusd.147.t:0 "Honorary Residents"
rusd.147.d:0 "Though the government of Dmitriy Romanov maintained the republic, but we somehow have to encourage the most important citizens of Russia, including the former aristocrats with the additional rights, strengthening their loyalty and willingness to cooperate with us. That's why President Romanov decides to restore the tradition of the giving the "honorary resident" titles, which will give some privileges to these people in various regions and cities of Russia."

rusd.148.t:0 "New Aristocracy"
rusd.148.d:0 "Though the noblemen in the Senate could defeat this terrible republic and restore the Empire, but they had to admit that the support of the new capitalists and industrialists played the significant role in this restoration. That's why it is the perfect time to show them our gratitude - the most powerful representatives of these classes, who helped us to strengthen the power of the Senate will get a title of nobility, which their descendants will be able to get as well."

This saint woman, who was killed in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, was de-facto a stepmother of her nephew Dmitriy Pavlovich, who decided to perpetuate her good deeds by making a great contribution into the Convent."
rusd.149.a:0 "It's all for you, Aunt Elizabeth..."

rusd.150.t:0 "'Triumph'"
rusd.150.d:0 "Ryabushinsky's Plant (also known as ZIR) is one of the major Russian automobile manufacturer, which also produced luxury vehicles in very low quantities, primarily for the officials and the other wealthy citizens of Russia. Though Black Monday seriously hurt the factory, the growing power of the aristocracy and businessmen made the market of the luxury vehicles once again very profitable for ZIR. That's why the name 'Triumph' was suggested for the new limousine ZIR-101, which the plant started to produce at the beginning of 1937."
rusd.150.a:0 "Vroom-vroom!"

rusd.151.t:0 "All Quiet in the Senate"
rusd.151.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. Though the problem is that Dmitriy Pavlovich doesn't always pay attention to the advice of the Senate and it often leads to the misunderstanding between the Grand Duke and this important state authority. But there are still good chances that they will find a proper way to negotiate and to recover Russia."
rusd.151.a:0 "We hope so."

rusd.152.t:0 "Dmitriy Pavlovich's New Power"
rusd.152.d:0 "Dmitriy Romanov took power by happy coincidence and isn't going to lose his position. Since he can't control both Duma and Senate, the Grand Duke is in great need of a completely obedient political power. That's why a new party, called 'Indivisible Russia' was created by Felix Yusupov, who has been Dmitriy's friend since childhood. This new party is ready to maintain interests of Russia and its Acting President."
rusd.152.a:0 "This Duma is nothing but a formality!"

rusd.153.t:0 "Dmitriy Romanov Assumes Power"
rusd.153.d:0 "After the death of Kerensky the Winter Palace in Petrograd wasn't vacant for long. Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov with the help of the old aristocracy and the new financial elite controls the biggest country in the world, as his royal ancestors did before the revolution. Playing the role of the 'good tsar' for the peasantry, Dmitriy Pavlovich guarantees that the new elite will save the property and money of the farmers. As in 1916 when he killed Rasputin, the Grand Duke is ready to act decisively in the name of Russian interests. His appeal to restore Russian glory and might is widely supported by the various layers of the nation. The people await his first actions."
rusd.153.a:0 "This Romanov can really charm!"

rusd.154.t:0 "The Summer Camps of 'Yunarmiya'"
rusd.154.d:0 "One of the most important aims of the 'Yunarmiya' is the formation of the summer camps for the children, where they will be able to spend summer and be involved in the various activities, studying the new ideology of Russia. Our Vozhd proposes that the first camp, called 'Sovyonok' ('Owlet') should be build in the Yekaterinodar region, on the Black Sea coast. It seems to be a perfect place for the Russian children, where they will have fun for three months."
rusd.154.a:0 "They will remember this summer as a long one, maybe even as an everlasting."
rusd.154.b:0 "No, we don't need it."

rusd.155.t:0 "The New Duma?"
rusd.155.d:0 "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - State Duma was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to reestablish this authority with the limited powers. Besides the People's Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as the conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, but there is a chance that once they will try to take control over the country..."
rusd.155.a:0 "NRPR is strong, but needs connections in the elite. Start the elections!"
rusd.155.b:0 "We don't need any independent legislators as well as the State Duma itself."

rusd.156.t:0 "The New Duma is elected!"
rusd.156.d:0 "After the elections to the State Duma, Savinkov's NRPR got 73%. The conservative and right parties as well as the movements, led by the representatives of the Russian business and industry got other 27% of the votes. It seems that the new legislators are ready to change Russian laws to improve the situation in the country."
rusd.156.a:0 "Very well."

rusd.157.t:0 "Disenfranchisement of the former Bolsheviks"
rusd.157.d:0 "'The whole question of Russia's existence depends on our understanding the true nature of Bolshevism and the nature of its supporters. We have to open our eyes to the fact that Bolshevism is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. That's exactly the reason why we should identify all its supporters and limit their influence to the life of the Russian Republic.' - with these words the main ideologist of the Russian "National Renewal" Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy explained the revocation of the right to vote as well as the part of the other civil rights for the members of the Bolshevik party and some former Soviet officials. With this measure, Boris Savinkov and NRPR are going to improve the situation in the Russian society and get rid of all these elements, who undermine the stability of Russia."
rusd.157.a:0 "You wanted to revoke our rights in 1917, but now you will lose yours."

rusd.158.t:0 "Vox Populi"
rusd.158.d:0 "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."
rusd.158.a:0 "Farewell Boris, farewell Boris, I'll see you in my dreams."

rusd.159.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
rusd.159.d:0 "'I'm so delighted with the events of January 1936, with the great heroic deed of the Knight, who raised with his hand the sword to kill the Devil. I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."
rusd.159.a:0 "Russia won't be a syndicalist country. Never."

rusd.160.t:0 "Purge them all?"
rusd.160.d:0 "More than 20,000 Bolsheviks, former Soviet officials, members of the Left SR, and Menshevik party members and leaders were arrested during these past few months. 3,000 of them were already sentenced to the death and executed. But more and more people in Russia, including members of the NRPR, demand that the government should end this policy once and for all. Although Savinkov and the Supreme Privy Council have decided to cease the purges, the question still remains: should these 17,000 people be jailed or should they be executed as enemies of the state?"
rusd.160.a:0 "Imprison them - we are not bloodthirsty Syndicalists after all."
rusd.160.b:0 "Without them Russia will be better - purge them all!"

rusd.161.t:0 "Trial of the Left Separatists"
rusd.161.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War, some of the national minorities which fought on the side of the Soviets against the White Army continued to disobey the central government, not only through acts of terrorism, but also using the opportunity to take part in the local legislative authorities, where they often found support among the left movements, such as the Mensheviks and parts of the Left SRs. This movement of local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov has accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups disloyal to Petrograd, he cannot forget about the problem of the Left Separatists, which still exist even after the proscription of the Russian Left SR party and its allies. Thanks to our Ministry of Security, the leaders, active members and terrorists from the most notorious Left Separatist movements have been arrested and their property has been nationalised."
rusd.161.a:0 "You fought the law and the law won!"

This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger.

They demand the cessation of all guarantees towards White Ruthenia and Ukraine as well as accepting these states as part of the Russian sphere of influence. In return they promise to respect the existing order in Europe and support German Empire economically in the ongoing war. How shall we respond?"
rusfor.1155.a:0 "Accept their demands!"
rusfor.1155.b:0 "Never!"

rusfor.1156.t:0 "German Empire refused our demands!"
rusfor.1156.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the German Empire has refused our reasonable demands regarding Eastern Europe, permanent peace between Russia and Germany seems impossible! What shall we do now?"
rusfor.1156.a:0 "Declare war upon the Reichspakt!"
rusfor.1156.b:0 "Declare war upon the Internationale!"
rusfor.1156.c:0 "Back down..."

rusfor.1157.t:0 "Ukraine has left the Reichspakt"
rusfor.1157.d:0 "The peasants and workers of the Ukraine have finally thrown off the shackles of German dependence, they have left the German-dominated the Reichspakt alliance. This presents us with the unique opportunity to either reclaim some of the territories we were forced to give up through the treaty of Brest-Litovsk or try to create a powerful new military bloc in eastern Europe with the Ukraine."
rusfor.1157.a:0 "A perfect chance to reintegrate Ukraine by force!"
rusfor.1157.b:0 "Offer an alliance to Ukraine."

rusfor.1158.t:0 "Ukraine has left the Reichspakt"
rusfor.1158.d:0 "Powerful German armies had been protecting Ukraine from annexation since the October revolution. Now that the Ukrainians have decided to break diplomatic relations with Germany we can reclaim the Ukraine. The peasants, who mostly are describing themselves as 'locals' instead of 'Ukrainians', are still angry about the agricultural crisis and they yearn for Tsarist era stability. Orthodox priests, many of them Russian, are complaining about closing churches and forced Ukranisation."
rusfor.1158.a:0 "We will liberate the Ukraine from the evil Syndicalists by force!"
rusfor.1158.b:0 "Start giving passports and citizenship to every Russian in Ukraine!"
rusfor.1158.c:0 "Covert operations will be good enough."

rusfor.1159.t:0 "Russia offers us an alliance!"
rusfor.1159.d:0 "The Russians have sent word that they consider our two states to be alike and they are suggesting that we should work together to promote the global cause of labour. What should we do?"
rusfor.1159.a:0 "Of course, all proletarians should work together!"
rusfor.1159.b:0 "We cannot trust the treacherous Russians!"

rusfor.1160.t:0 "A new power in the east!"
rusfor.1160.d:0 "The government of the Ukraine has accepted our offer, a new power in the east is born. With such a powerful alliance emerging on the global stage the future of the proletariat looks promising."
rusfor.1160.a:0 "Excellent!"

rusfor.1161.t:0 "Ukraine turned us down!"
rusfor.1161.d:0 "In their arrogance the government of the Ukraine has turned down our offer, saying that the ideological rift between us is too great for an alliance to form. How shall we react to this humiliation?"
rusfor.1161.a:0 "They shall pay for their foolishness!"
rusfor.1161.b:0 "Let them rot."

rusfor.1162.t:0 "Russians are giving passports!"
rusfor.1162.d:0 "Thousands of our citizens are rushing for passports given by the Russian government. This is a threat to our stability, security, and the integrity of our country! We must do something about this before they try to secede."
rusfor.1162.a:0 "Give them Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, they have a majority there."
rusfor.1162.b:0 "We will punish them, comrades to arms!"
rusfor.1162.c:0 "Do nothing."

rusfor.1163.t:0 "Our actions succeeded!"
rusfor.1163.d:0 "Ukrainians, fearing unrest, decided to give us Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. How we shall respond?"
rusfor.1163.a:0 "We want all of the Ukraine."
rusfor.1163.b:0 "We are content with what we have."

rusfor.1164.t:0 "Crimea and Eastern Ukraine seceded!"
rusfor.1164.d:0 "Our tolerance for Russian actions has allowed them to take Crimea and Eastern Ukraine."
rusfor.1164.a:0 "This means war!"
rusfor.1164.b:0 "We will remember this!"

rusfor.1165.t:0 "Our policy towards Ukraine"
rusfor.1165.d:0 "The Russians in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea have rebelled and decided to join Russia. Now, when Ukrainian state is even weaker than before, which next steps should we make?"
rusfor.1165.a:0 "Claim the rest of Ukraine!"
rusfor.1165.b:0 "Eastern Ukraine and Crimea are enough, we have to integrate these areas."

rusfor.1166.t:0 "Russian coup succeed"
rusfor.1166.d:0 "We have managed to replace the Syndicalist Ukrainian government with a more loyal one."
rusfor.1166.a:0 "Great!"

rusfor.1167.t:0 "Russian coup failed"
rusfor.1167.d:0 "We have failed to replace the Syndicalist Ukrainian government with a more loyal one."
rusfor.1167.a:0 "Then we should declare war!"
rusfor.1167.b:0 "Then we shall wait."

rusfor.1168.t:0 "Russian coup in Ukraine - relations with Russia"
rusfor.1168.d:0 "Khruschev was dismissed by pro-Russian politicians. Now the future of the Ukraine lies in their hands. What will we do?"
rusfor.1168.a:0 "Press for total unification!"
rusfor.1168.b:0 "Only cooperation."

rusfor.1169.t:0 "Malorossia wants to join Russia"
rusfor.1169.d:0 "The new Malorossian cabinet decided that they will fully join our motherland."
rusfor.1169.a:0 "Hooray!"
rusfor.1169.b:0 "Keep them independent under our supervision."
rusfor.1169.c:0 "We don't need them!"

rusfor.1170.t:0 "Malorossia wants to create a union with Russia"
rusfor.1170.d:0 "The new Malorosian cabinet has decided that they will submit to Russia while keeping their state formally independent."
rusfor.1170.a:0 "Great!"
rusfor.1170.b:0 "Claim the Ukraine!"
rusfor.1170.c:0 "We don't need them."

rusfor.1179.t:0 "Claiming Bessarabia"
rusfor.1179.d:0 "Bessarabia was occupied by Romanian Forces on 27 march 1918. Now, with Ukraine under our direct rule, we have finally achieved an access to the Romanian border. The current international situation is favourable for us to claim Bessarabia and retake it from Romania."
rusfor.1179.a:0 "Insist on returning of Bessarabia."
rusfor.1179.b:0 "Insist on returning of Bessarabia."
rusfor.1179.c:0 "Take part in Romanian civil war."

rusfor.1180.t:0 "Russian demands"
rusfor.1180.d:0 "Yesterday Russian government demanded the return of Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, we will lost 1/3 of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate Russian invasion. How should we react to these awful claims of Russian leadership?"
rusfor.1180.a:0 "Accept their terms."
rusfor.1180.b:0 "Never!"
rusfor.1180.c:0 "Counteroffer - Bessarabia for alliance."

rusfor.1181.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] refuses!"
rusfor.1181.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government published a note, where insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Russia will never get it back. The only solution of this problem for us is war with [FROM.GetNameDef]."
rusfor.1181.a:0 "Then it is war."

rusfor.1210.t:0 "Ultimatum for Galicia"
rusfor.1210.d:0 "The Russians sent us an ultimatum, they want us to cede Galicia to them or they will declare war on us, how shall we react?"
rusfor.1210.a:0 "We must accept it."
rusfor.1210.b:0 "Refuse the offer, let them come!"
rusfor.1210.c:0 "A preemptive strike is necessary."

rusfor.1211.t:0 "Austria accepts"
rusfor.1211.d:0 "Austria ceded us Galicia in response of our ultimatum, we are victorious!"
rusfor.1211.a:0 "Hurrah!"

rusfor.1212.t:0 "Austria refuses!"
rusfor.1212.d:0 "The mad Austrians are defying our power by refusing our ultimatum, how shall we react to this infamy?"
rusfor.1212.a:0 "Then it's war."

rusfor.1222.t:0 "Austria betrayed us!"
rusfor.1222.d:0 "In consequence of the Russian ultimatum the Austrians left us alone against this threat. What shall we do?"
rusfor.1222.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
rusfor.1222.b:0 "Resist to the invader!"

rusfor.1223.t:0 "Galicia attacks us!"
rusfor.1223.d:0 "After being left alone against us by the Austrian cowards the Galicians decided to resist our annexation of their territory."
rusfor.1223.a:0 "We will crush them!"

rusfor.1229.t:0 "Russian claims"
rusfor.1229.d:0 "Today the Russian foreign minister has met with our prime minister. He has announced that the Russian state wants to take back Vyborg and a part of Karelia. They are offering us monetary and material compensation as well as a guarantee of the new state borders in return. How shall we react?"
rusfor.1229.a:0 "Never!"
rusfor.1229.b:0 "All right."

rusfor.1230.t:0 "Finland refused!"
rusfor.1230.d:0 "The Kingdom of Finland has refused our generous offer to transfer Vyborg and a part of Karelia back to the motherland! We must take our rightful lands back by force!"
rusfor.1230.a:0 "Take it back by force!"
rusfor.1230.b:0 "Forget about it."

rusfor.1231.t:0 "Transfer of the territory"
rusfor.1231.d:0 "The Kingdom of Finland has agreed to transfer the larger part of Karelia in return for monetary and material compensation as well as the guarantee of the security of their new borders!"
rusfor.1231.a:0 "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

rusfor.1232.t:0 "We've been defeated!"
rusfor.1232.d:0 "Armed forces of the Russian state have inflicted a series of great defeats upon us. We must end this war before they manage to overrun our entire homeland."

rusfor.1232.b:0 "We can still win this!"

rusfor.1233.t:0 "Peace with Finland?"
rusfor.1233.d:0 "With the reconquest of Karelia the government of Finland has declared their desire to end the state of war between our nations, accepting our sovereignty over Karelia in the process. How shall we respond?"

rusfor.1233.b:0 "No, they shall be crushed!"

rusfor.1234.t:0 "Treaty of Petrograd"

rusfor.1235.d:0 "Our invincible armed forces have managed to revert the injustices imposed on us during the Russian civil war. The entire nation celebrates this enormous victory!"
rusfor.1235.a:0 "Russia stands triumphant!"

rusfor.1265.t:0 "White Ruthenian bonds"
rusfor.1265.d:0 "White Ruthenia was occupied by the Germans in 1918 and later Berlin installed a loyal regime with the German prince on the top. Now however, the White Ruthenian economy is unstable and weak. We can reach an agreement about the purchase of almost all their state bonds, and if they agree with it, we will be able to control their economy, their government, and maybe eventually fully incorporate the country."
rusfor.1265.a:0 "Let's buy them!"
rusfor.1265.b:0 "We shall take back our stolen lands by force!"
rusfor.1265.c:0 "We don't need them."

rusfor.1266.t:0 "Russia wants to buy our state bonds"
rusfor.1266.d:0 "The Russian ambassador has proposed the purchase of almost all our state bonds. Though we will be able to use this money to rebuild our economy, but we will actually become very dependent from Russia!"
rusfor.1266.a:0 "It's a deal!"
rusfor.1266.b:0 "Maybe the Germans will be able to help us."
rusfor.1266.c:0 "We don't need the Russian money!"

rusfor.1267.t:0 "White Ruthenia agrees!"
rusfor.1267.d:0 "Good news from Minsk! The government of White Ruthenia has decided to sell their state bonds to us! Finally the former kingdom is under our direct control and we have become closer to the reunification of the Russian lands!"
rusfor.1267.a:0 "Great!"

rusfor.1268.t:0 "Integration"
rusfor.1268.d:0 "The former kingdom of White Ruthenia was long enough under our control. Should we finally reincorporate it into Russia?"
rusfor.1268.a:0 "Yes, of course!"
rusfor.1268.b:0 "We don't need them."

rusfor.1269.t:0 "White Ruthenia needs our help!"
rusfor.1269.d:0 "The government of White Ruthenia wants our support, because Russia is going to buy their state bonds to control the economy of this small country. It seems that if we don't intervene, White Ruthenia will be soon annexed by the Russians!"
rusfor.1269.a:0 "Warn Russia, they must turn back!"
rusfor.1269.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1270.t:0 "Germany supports White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.1270.d:0 "The Germans don't allow us to buy White Ruthenian state bonds. It seems that the Germans are ready to defend their sphere of influence in the Eastern Europe. What should we do?"
rusfor.1270.a:0 "We shall take back our stolen lands by force, right now!"
rusfor.1270.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.1271.t:0 "We are alone!"
rusfor.1271.d:0 "Terrible news! The Germans aren't going to help us. It seems that they don't care about our future! But we still have this Russian proposition. What should we do now?"
rusfor.1271.a:0 "Let's cooperate with the Russians!"
rusfor.1271.b:0 "We will fight alone!"

rusfor.1272.t:0 "White Ruthenia is alone!"
rusfor.1272.d:0 "The German government doesn't want to protect White Ruthenia. But White Ruthenia isn't going to sell us their state bonds. Maybe we should take back our lands, using our army?"
rusfor.1272.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1272.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.12722.t:0 "Russia is threatening our hold on White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.12722.d:0 "Russia offered our puppet White Ruthenia to buy some of its state bonds and is now going to control most of its economy. Unfortunately the White Ruthenian government accepted this offer and Russia is now closer than ever from annexing White Ruthenia to their empire for good. Should we intervene?"
rusfor.12722.a:0 "Unacceptable! We'll take back our puppet!"
rusfor.12722.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1273.t:0 "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."
rusfor.1273.a:0 "Create a new Spiritual Administration."
rusfor.1273.b:0 "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

rusfor.1274.t:0 "Problems in Central Asia."
rusfor.1274.d:0 "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.1274.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusfor.1275.t:0 "Pacification of Central Asia."
rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"
rusfor.1276.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d1:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"
rusfor.1279.a:0 "Perfect!"
