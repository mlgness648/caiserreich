### Decisions ###
JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle:0 "Preparations for the War of Unification"
JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle_desc:0 "Time has not been very kind to the House of Rashid. Losing most of their male family members at the hands of the Ibn Saud and suffering from continous raids into their territory by the Ikhwan, the Rashidi federation of Emirs is cracking under the weight of the Wahabbists. Support by the Ottoman Empire is keeping our dominion on its feet however as their continued partnership and alliance with our Emir ensures his lands are safe. Further reinforced in 1925 when the former British protectorates of the Trucial States, Qatar and Bahrain were placed under our supervision, ties with the Sultan are strong.\n\nNonetheless some have argued that this partnership is the only thing keeping our realm together and should disaster befall the Ottomans, Ibn Saud may see it as his destiny to unite the peninsula under his rule."

JBS_War_of_Unification:0 "Arab War of Unification"
JBS_War_of_Unification_desc:0 "The final struggle for control over the Arab interior is rapidly approaching, as the Ottoman behemoth is cracking under the weight of the worldwide economic depression, temporarily unable to maintain peace on the peninsula. All Emirs will have to pick a side, for the future of the Arab world will be written in blood. Those who win will have the chance to shape the destiny of the Arabs. The losers will find themselves disgraced, cast aside or slain on the field of battle."
JBS_Counter_SAU_UAE:0 "Counter Saudi influence in the Trucial States"
JBS_Counter_SAU_UAE_desc:0 "As our power in the region diminishes, the cronies of Ibn Saud are trying to sway the Emirs of the Trucial States to his banner. Promising riches, weapons, departure of the Turk and the purification of the Islamic faith, many seem to be aligning themselves with him or at least considering his offer. We need to outbid Ibn Saud or we may find ourselves very rapidly without allies in the Persian Gulf."
JBS_Counter_SAU_Qatar:0 "Counter Saudi influence in Qatar"
JBS_Counter_SAU_Qatar_desc:0 "As our power in the region diminishes, the cronies of Ibn Saud are trying to sway the Emir of Qatar to his banner.

We need to outbid Ibn Saud or we may find ourselves very rapidly without allies in the Persian Gulf."
JBS_Counter_SAU_Bahrain:0 "Counter Saudi influence in Bahrain"
JBS_Counter_SAU_Bahrain_desc:0 "As our power in the region diminishes, the cronies of Ibn Saud are trying to sway the Emir of Bahrain to his banner.

We need to outbid Ibn Saud or we may find ourselves very rapidly without allies in the Persian Gulf."
JBS_Counter_SAU_Arabian_Desert:0 "Counter Saudi influence in the Arabian Desert"
JBS_Counter_SAU_Arabian_Desert_desc:0 "Camels of the Ikhwan have been spotted on the horizon raiding and sacking their way through the surrounding of Hafar Al-Batin. We need to mobilise our own army to push them out again, lest the Saudis may claim the region as theirs."
JBS_Counter_SAU_Al_Hasa:0 "Counter Saudi influence in Al-Hasa"
JBS_Counter_SAU_Al_Hasa_desc:0 "The Coastal strip of Al-Hasa is under siege by the Ikwhan! Should we lose this vital region, we will be cut off from our allies further South so it is of the utmost importance that we do not let the port fall into the hands of the Saudis"

JBS_Ottoman_Favours:0 "Diplomacy with the Sublime Porte"
JBS_Ottoman_Favours_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire, commonly refered to as the Sublime Porte, is our largest ally in the region and also its strongest military.

JBS_Ottoman_Training:0 "Invite Experts from the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi"
JBS_Ottoman_Training_desc:0 "The Ottomans have fought a bloody war with us at their side two decades ago but even then it was clear who had the doctrinal advantage. Fighting war for close to a decade on end, the Ottomans are battle hardened, trained and capable of providing us with all the assistance necessary to reform our army."
JBS_Ottoman_Weapons_Assistance:0 "Military Contract with ATF"
JBS_Ottoman_Weapons_Assistance_desc:0 "The facilities of Ankara Tüfek Fabrikasi are producing the finest weapons in the Middle East which we will dearly need should we expect to stand a chance against the forces of Ibn Saud on our own."
JBS_Sell_out_to_TPC:0 "Sign the TPC Concession"
JBS_Sell_out_to_TPC_desc:0 "Whilst for now only rumours exist of oil deposits under the sands of Arabia, various companies including the Turkish TPC have shown an interest in purchasing concessions on our land. As we are scratching the bottom of our purses for further funds, this may be an option to consider although should oil indeed be found this could bite us in the back later on."

JBS_consolidating_iraq_i_arab_desc:0 "As our rule reaches these ancient lands, we reach the jewel of the Mashriq, Baghdad, but also many other towns who are unaware of sometimes who we even are! If Arabia is to stand as one, the grand machinery of the state must reach Iraq-i-Arab."

The latter group, including the Al Nahyan, Hashimites and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alleigence to Jabal Shammar.
