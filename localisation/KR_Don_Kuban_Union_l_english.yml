### Events ###
dkb.1.t:0 "Don-Kuban Union"
dkb.1.d:0 "Don-Kuban Union was proclaimed by Pyotr Krasnov on the 18th of May 1918, when he was elected as the 'Ataman' ('Leader') of the Don Cossacks. Since then Krasnov, who used to be a connecting link between the leadership of the White Army and the Germans, started to strengthen his regime in South Russia, by improving his relations with the separatist leaders of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks. With the German help Don-Kuban Union could finally break away from Russia, which Krasnov as the Ataman of the Union condemned for its new republican system, using the conservative and pro-monarchist feelings of the South Russian population. But the new established Union still have to face with lots of problems. The lack of the modern industry weakens the army of the Union, the people want the land redistribution and reunification with Russia, the separatist tensions in the various parts of the Caucasus grow. If Pyotr Krasnov wants to stay as the Ataman of the Don-Kuban Union, he will have to deal with all these problems in his country."
dkb.1.a:0 "Krasnov should bring an order to the Union."

dkb.2.t:0 "Cossack Circle"
dkb.2.d:0 "'Kazachiy Krug' ('Cossack Circle') is the main legislative and executive state authority in Don-Kuban Union. The member of this 'Krug' represents the Russians, Don, Kuban and Terek Cossacks, the Kalmyks, the Chechens and other minorities in our country. This authority has a right to discuss almost every significant question, which has relation to the life in the country. Though Krasnov can promulgate his orders even without the approval of the 'Krug', but he has to consider its opinion in every case, if he wants to remain control over the Union."
dkb.2.a:0 "This 'Krug' is very important."

dkb.3.t:0 "Berlin Stock Crisis comes to the Don-Kuban Union"
dkb.3.d:0 "As predicted the Union's finances and economy are in deep crisis. The average Cossack faces problems selling his products and a number of factories are closing. This means that various dangerous elements will have a greater impact upon the political landscape of the Cossack country."
dkb.3.a:0 "God save us from the worst."

dkb.4.t:0 "Initial stabilisation"
dkb.4.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced off the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
dkb.4.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon."

dkb.5.t:0 "Further stabilisation"
dkb.5.d:0 "The economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
dkb.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

dkb.6.t:0 "An Illegal trade union was found"
dkb.6.d:0 "We have found another secret trade union in one of our factories. Workers have united to demand higher wages and better workplaces. We must blame the spread of syndicalist propaganda for this!"
dkb.6.a:0 "Allow to operate but watch them closely."
dkb.6.b:0 "Disband the union and arrest the workers!"

dkb.7.t:0 "Ukrainian language in the Kuban region"
dkb.7.d:0 "The Ukrainian officials, who once tried to include Kuban region with our capital Yekaterinodar into Ukraine, but were stopped by Krasnov and the local Cossack and White armies, don't stop their attempts to gain an influence in our country. This time the Ukrainians propose us to acknowledge the Ukrainian language as the second official in Kuban. They have support from some members of the Kuban Cossacks in the 'Krug', who hopes that the Ukrainian help will allow them to strengthen their position in the country. On the contrary the Don Cossacks reject any agreement with the Ukrainians, since the Kingdom of Ukraine occupied a large part of the Don lands at the end of the Russian civil war."
dkb.7.a:0 "The Don Cossacks are right - we should claim our lands!"
dkb.7.b:0 "Make a compromise - the Ukrainians can fund some schools in the Kuban."
dkb.7.c:0 "The Ukrainian language the second language in the Kuban region!"

dkb.8.t:0 "Land redistribution in Stavropol"
dkb.8.d:0 "The Stavropol region has the Russian majority, but the Kalmyks, who live in the Steppes near the Caspian Sea, claim that some of these lands in Stavropol should become a part of the Kalmykia. But the Russians suppose that the Kalmyks took lots of the peasant's lands in Stavropol during the civil war and the government must launch a land redistribution in the northern part of Stavropol region. What should we do?"
dkb.8.a:0 "The Russians are right - give these lands back to them."
dkb.8.b:0 "We won't start any land redistribution."
dkb.8.c:0 "The Kalmyks will get new lands!"

dkb.9.t:0 "Sharia courts in Chechnya"
dkb.9.d:0 "The Terek river divides the lands of the Terek Cossacks in the North and the Chechen lands in the South. The Chechens has asked us to allow them use the Sharia law and have the Sharia courts. The Terek Cossacks think that this decision will lead to the radicalisation in this region and new clashes between the local Cossacks and the Chechens. That's why the Cossacks suppose that they should have a right to arrest the radical Muslim priests who use the rules of Islam to solve different cases in the Chechen region. We have to give them our answer."
dkb.9.a:0 "The Cossacks will bring an order in Chechnya!"
dkb.9.b:0 "We are a secular state, but only state authorities will arrest lawbreakers."
dkb.9.c:0 "The Chechens can use the Sharia law - it is a Muslim tradition..."

dkb.10.t:0 "Assassination attempt!"
dkb.10.d:0 "Today the Ataman's residence was attacked by a group of the unknown terrorists who obviously intended to kill our leader Pyots Krasnov! It seems that the main reason was the unpopular reforms, which provoked the instability in the Don-Kuban Union. From now the Ataman and his supporters have to lead much more elaborate policy to restore the order in the country and reduce the dissent of the nation."
dkb.10.a:0 "Keep calm and carry on!"
