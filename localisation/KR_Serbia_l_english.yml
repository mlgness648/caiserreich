### Event text ###
serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time however the government has become increasingly anti-Austrian and jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attentions southwards, towards the lands occupied by Bulgaria. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nCan Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"

serbia.15.t:0 "Status of the Orthodox Church"
serbia.15.d:0 "The Orthodox Church, under the leadership of the vocal Patriarch Varnava Rosić, is demanding a reclarification of its legal status in the Serbian state. He wants a constitutional amendment passed on the issue of the national religion."
serbia.15.a:0 "Orthodoxy is our state religion."
serbia.15.b:0 "We are modern and secular!"
serbia.15.c:0 "The Orthodox Church must have a role in our government."

serbia.16.t:0 "Serbia Asks for Montenegro"
serbia.16.d:0 "The resurgent Serbian state today pressured us to give up Montenegro. The largely Serbian population of that province has for some time voiced their wish to join Serbia. In return for the province, Serbia has told us they will not demand any further Illyrian land."
serbia.16.a:0 "It will be for the best."
serbia.16.b:0 "Serbia should stay small."

serbia.17.t:0 "[From.GetName] Cedes Montenegro"
serbia.17.d:0 "Today, Serbia has finally gained access to the Adriatic coast. [From.GetName] agreed to cede to us Montenegro, in return for guarantees of Illyrian territorial integrity. Of course, we will only uphold those for as long as we see it fit."
serbia.17.a:0 "Welcome to the fatherland, brethren."

serbia.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Cede Montenegro"
serbia.18.d:0 "Our enemies in [From.GetName] have refused to cede Montenegro, which should be rightfully ours. With all diplomatic options depleted, the only thing that we can do is to go to war for Montenegro."
serbia.18.a:0 "Attack!"
serbia.18.b:0 "Unfortunately, we have to bide our time."

serbia.19.t:0 "Building the First Ships For Our Navy"
serbia.19.d:0 "If we focus our newly gained resources, we will be able to produce destroyers and cruisers, which will form the backbone of our navy."
serbia.19.a:0 "We have waited long enough!"
serbia.19.b:0 "This is too expensive, focus on research for now."

serbia.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy the HMS Lion"
serbia.20.d:0 "[From.GetName], which is in a process of industrialisation and rearmament, has offered to buy the outdated battlecruiser HMS Lion which will become the flagship of their navy. This will surely lead to better relations with the [From.GetAdjective] government and can help them in taking on the navies of their neighbours."
serbia.20.a:0 "We could profit from selling this old junk."
serbia.20.b:0 "No, every ship is needed!"

serbia.21.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
serbia.21.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sell us the HMS Lion. They have transferred command over to us, but we need to navigate her to Serbia ourselves. With this addition our navy can reign over the Adriatic Sea."
serbia.21.a:0 "A day for celebration!"

serbia.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
serbia.22.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to sell us an old battlecruiser to serve as the flagship of our fleet. We have to search for another solution. The navy has come forward with a proposal to design a heavy cruiser class ourselves. This would still take quite some time to finish."
serbia.22.a:0 "We will remember this."

serbia.23.t:0 "Integration of Albania"
serbia.23.d:0 "Albania is a part of our country, but large parts of the population resent our presence. We can start an integration process to bring them more in line with our policies, eventually making them an integral part of the [Root.GetAdjective] state."
serbia.23.a:0 "Start the integration process!"
serbia.23.b:0 "This is not a good idea."
serbia.23.tt:0 "§YThis will cause great unrest in Albania§!"

serbia.24.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.24.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but already the local population is greatly resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies.

serbia.24.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.24.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.25.t:0 "Tensions Calmed in Albania"
serbia.25.d:0 "The integration process of Albania resulted in a lot of tensions with the local populace. Our police and military have committed to find and jail those responsible for their revolutionary talks, and most of them are rounded up. As a result the tensions have calmed down, and we can continue our effort to fully integrate them into the Serbian state."
serbia.25.a:0 "Great!"

serbia.26.t:0 "Albania Integrated"
serbia.26.d:0 "We have completed the integration process of Albania. We can now finally say that Albania is an integral part of the Serbian state."

serbia.27.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.27.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but the local population is resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies.

Regardless, some politicians suggest to abandon our attempts to fully integrate Albania into Serbia."
serbia.27.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.27.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.28.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.28.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but the local population is resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies. So far, their resistance has been limited to some demonstrations in Tirana and sporadic acts of civil disobedience. Regardless, some politicians suggest to abandon our attempts to fully integrate Albania into Serbia."
serbia.28.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.28.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.29.t:0 "Call for Revolution in Albania"
serbia.29.d:0 "Our integration process of Albania has not been successful. The local population continues to resist our occupation in great numbers, making life very hard for Serbians. Word has reached us that some rebel groups are calling for an outright revolution against our occupation. Doves in our government argue that enough blood has been shed, and that Albania should be granted limited autonomy."
serbia.29.a:0 "We do not yield!"
serbia.29.b:0 "Grant Albania limited autonomy."

serbia.30.t:0 "Revolution in Albania"
serbia.30.d:0 "Our integration process of Albania has not been successful. Rebel groups have seized control of Tirana and the surrounding country side. Albania is in open revolt in their struggle for independence."
serbia.30.a:0 "Attack!"
serbia.30.b:0 "Let them go."
