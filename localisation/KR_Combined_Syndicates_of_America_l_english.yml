If we sponsor nation-wide strikes with a clear syndicalist connection, there is a feeling they'll be too paranoid to take action. We can only do this so many times before the Canadians figure out where the funds are coming from, however."

### Reconstruction Focuses ###
CSA_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "The great American Revolution is over, but unless something is done the wounds we have torn open in this country will continue to fester and bleed. We must work with haste to build up an egalitarian, equal and enduring America, from the ruins of the old."
CSA_social_revolution:0 "Social Revolution"
CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but, we have our work cut out for us to rid America of corruption, racism and chauvinism. Yet first we must tear up the very core of all these things, the capitalist system itself!"
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribute Wealth"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "We will no longer tolerate a social order wherein men who do absolutely nothing useful can amass millions of dollars, while millions of proletariats who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough to prolong a wretched existence. The end of the banks, corporations and hoarders is finally here."
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "Homes for the People"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "Landlords and real estate tycoons have been a plague upon this nation. Let us lift the poor and starving from their slums, now that the rich and mighty have been driven from their seats of power."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "Emancipation for All"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "Foolish and vain is the workingman who makes the color of his skin the stepping-stone to his imaginary superiority. Proletariat of all colors and creed fought and bled to build our new America. The loyal immigrant shall also be afforded Natural Born Citizenship in the spirit of emancipation."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "Women's Liberation"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "With the men dying on the front lines, it fell to the women to run the factories, build the munitions and feed our revolution! That's to say nothing for the many nurses, pilots and female Red Guard members who gave their all. Their sacrifices and struggles will not have been in vain."
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "Revolutionary Education"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "Academia has been the nurturing mother of many revolutionaries, but the education system itself is still inherently reactionary. In all of America's history, it was built to produce more obedient workers, more crooked capitalists and heartless politicians. That ends now!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "Deal with the Feds"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "Since the revolution broke out, we've accumulated an extensive list of political prisoners whom are awaiting trial. Now that the war is over, the time to judge these men has finally come. Although some amongst our leadership believes in rehabilitating these captives, other more radical comrades are eagerly calling for extreme revolutionary justice."
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "Transformative Justice"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "Although we've firmly dealt with the old American elite, there's still a sizable popular movement opposing our new regime. We'll need to pacify any remaining counter-revolutionary cells, and make sure to track down every last infiltrator in our midst before we can finally be sure we've won."
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "Deal with America First"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "Huey Long's foul crew of reactionary demagogues, heartless industrialists and tyrannical generals will finally stand on trial. Although the Kingfish himself has escaped capture, we'll eagerly dish out a fair punishment to everyone who collaborated with him."
CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "Destroy Jim Crow"
CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "Ridding ourselves of the southern terrorists will not just be a matter of military might. We'll need to uproot the bigotry and racism that's plagued America for centuries, and crush Long's cult of personality. Let us make Lincoln proud and bring old Dixie down, once and for all!"
CSA_equality_for_all:0 "Equality for All"
CSA_equality_for_all_desc:0 "The long-fought battle for liberty looks to be almost over. The old hierarchies and horrors are fading away, soon the American injustices will be nothing but bitter memories and the stuff of history books."
CSA_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The crimes of this guilty nation seem to finally have been washed away, even if it took blood and fire to break the old system. We have brought to birth a new world from the ashes of the old. A land of free, equal and prosperous laborers!"
CSA_a_new_america:0 "A New America"
CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone. We have laid the wide foundations, built it skyward stone by stone. It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own\nFor the Union makes us strong!"
### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "The time has come to decide the next step in our revolutionary struggle, to find a way to unite workers behind a single cause and ideology. Although our delegates come from a wide variety of unions and communes, we hope for a consensus on the future of socialist government. Like it was, over a century ago, we shall let Philadelphia be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of America"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny, our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Union-based Socialism will reign, succeeding the nationalism of Bellamy, but as social and economic freedom for all workers and toilers of our nation!"
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect the Working Class"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "While many new ideas for a better economic system have existed in theory in America, the turmoil of the civil war made putting any of them into practice a difficult endeavour. Now though, we have ample time and opportunity to build the working man's democracy through Amendments protecting worker rights."
CSA_empower_councils:0 "Townhall Democracy"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means, we must pursue a better class character for our democracy. Through laws empowering grassroots engagement and town hall meetings, political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill, they will be right amongst the workers!"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Craft Union Committee"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Reforming the capitalist system will be a herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress now begins assembling local representatives of Craft Unions in order to determine the best fit for economic growth while protecting professional workers from obsolescence. "
CSA_councilism:0 "Councilism"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless. A compromise between the Craft and Industrial Unions was in the implementation of decentralized worker councils. These Councils will allow states to exert autonomous power in how unions are organized."
CSA_federalism:0 "Federalism"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, gerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. With compromise between Craft and Industrial unions impossible, we must rely on this cornerstone as the first American revolutionaries did."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "Power to the People"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "Perhaps for the first time in our nation's history, true democracy is flourishing. Not the illusion of freedom, concocted by corrupted politicians and greedy businessmen, but real direct democratic means of governing our new Commonwealth! We enshrine this power in the unassailable Amendments."
CSA_federalist_economics:0 "Business Unionism"
CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Business Unionism', calling it a betrayal of the revolution. What they fail the realize is that with 200 years of Capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has ended state-controlled pricing passed under Reed."
CSA_mutualism:0 "Protectionist Policies"
CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "The Councils of Professional Workers have concluded that a protectionist policy towards American goods is in order, but not as drastic as the old Smoot Hawley Tariff Act. A softer approach will see increased tax breaks for unions that operate solely in the states, as well as a propaganda push to 'Buy American' as we should have done during the first Weltkrieg."
CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "Worker's Cooperatives"
CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "The dominance of industrial unions need not mean the death of enterprise! We shall simply replace the bosses who take an unjust cut of the profits. Instead let the workers decide within their workplaces, dividing the wealth fairly amongst themselves."
CSA_social_dividends:0 "Social Dividends"
CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "Congress has passed a law instituting a basic universal income, wherein a portion of all profit generated from state run enterprises will be divided amongst our citizens. Our laborers are not just mere subjects, they're the very thing that keep our nation running, so they shall hereby be entitled to some of America's collective wealth!"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "Publicly Owned Enterprise"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "Public Enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as countless of our old presidents were beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. As we've now broken the yoke of corporations, Congress has finally legalized made use of public ownership. Rooseveltism and conservationists only hold us back!"
CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "New American Syndicalism"
CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "America has finally left exploitative Capitalism behind, and entered into the first transitional period towards a brighter future. Though some in Congress still mock our idea of 'Syndicalism with American Characteristics', they cannot complain about when industries roar with energy, and our people celebrate yet unknown prosperity!"
CSA_unionist_economics:0 "Industrial Unionism"
CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "Although there has been some push for a synthesis between Syndicalism and Business Unionism, it’s obvious to us that there can be no compromise with the old system. Industrial labor unions must rise to become the dominant force within our economy, unions now empower every extent of the Commonwealth government."
CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "Syndicalist Dominance"
CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "Whereas markets were previously decided by supply and demand, or the whims of investors, our new system will be built by and for demand side economics. Congress has declared that workers must register unions with the IWW or risk fines and loss of benefits."
CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "Worker's Self-Management"
CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces. Thus, a law illegalizes Executive Officers and preferred stockholder voting rights. Now Unions can take control over all of the means of production through common shares ownership."
CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
CSA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is integral to the American identity. Yet for far too long, whatever fig leaf of democracy was left at the factory door as Americans became slaves to petty tyrants. No longer. Congress has mandated a new Industrial Democracy Committee to promote cooperation between unions towards a democratic goal."
CSA_agricultural_unions:0 "Agricultural Unions"
CSA_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "The Agricultural sector will be obliged to feed our nation, but other than that broad instruction, we can allow the farmers to operate mostly independently. Congress has extended union protection to agricultural workers, enabling them to unionize and join the IWW."
CSA_syndicalist_economics:0 "Decentralized Planning"
CSA_syndicalist_economics_desc:0 "State governments have brought forth an awakening of self-sustaining communes in the cities and even counties. Cooperating closely with their neighbors and maintaining a well-functioning social order. Although this system is nowhere near utopian, it is the first step towards a true worker's paradise!"
CSA_protect_the_revolution:0 "Protect the Revolution"
CSA_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "Maintaining and protecting the spirit of the revolution will be vital in the coming years. We face enormous outside pressure from the reactionary powers around the world, sabotage from dissidents within our own nation, and the strife of factionalism even amongst our leadership. Our will isn't yet broken though, the struggle continues!"
CSA_general_defense_comitte:0 "General Defence Committee"
CSA_general_defense_comitte_desc:0 "Entrusting military leadership and the safety our nation to a group of elites can only end poorly. We must ensure that our Commonwealth remains meritocratic and free from corruption, as such Congress has organized a committee of union advisers and military strategists."
CSA_indepedent_media:0 "Protect Free Speech"
CSA_indepedent_media_desc:0 "The free media and the right to free speech is an unalienable right to the American people. The Court system has reaffirmed the right to free speech in spite of calls for censorship. Let the reactionaries and traitors shout what they will, their treasonous drivel be drowned out by the cries of our comrades celebrating a new age of prosperity!"
CSA_strategic_services:0 "Committee of Strategic Services"
CSA_strategic_services_desc:0 "While the General Defence Committee has proven quite effective it has also been criticized as being too open and public. It is a shame to have to conspire in secret from our citizens, but we can at least ensure that this second Congressional Committee will uphold the spirit of the revolution and be closely supervised."
CSA_the_revolution_continues:0 "The Revolution Continues"
CSA_the_revolution_continues_desc:0 "With stability brought to our democratic government, our economy and internal security, we can begin to heal. The scars from the Civil War will last many more years, but that doesn't mean our nation is infirm and weak. The struggle continues, the fires of revolution still burn, and the Commonwealth shall stand tall as a liberating force for all!"
### Union of American States Focuses ###
CSA_usas:0 "Union of Socialist American States"
CSA_usas_desc:0 "The authoritarian is ascendant, as the petty squabbles of the Constitutional Convention have ended in favour of a strong and centrist Marxist government. The USAS will show the world that the civil war has done nothing to reduce nations strength and influence, it has merely been redirected to the new revolutionary cause of Vanguardism!"
CSA_lead_the_revolution:0 "Lead The Revolution"
CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Vanguardist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or AFL backsliding. Thankfully our loyal Craft Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
CSA_peoples_commisars:0 "People's Commissars"
CSA_peoples_commisars_desc:0 "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars. These watchful and vigilant citizens kept a close eye on any potential counterrevolutionaries within our ranks. Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
CSA_control_townhalls:0 "Sign the Hall-Ballam Act"
CSA_control_townhalls_desc:0 "The issue of loyalty is becoming a wedge that is beginning to drive Congress apart. To fix this, Gus Hall and John Ballam have brought to the floor a Bill to require affidavits of loyalty for USAS elected officials. This law ensures the safety of all by prosecuting those in politics guilty of treason in any form."
CSA_politics:0 "Democratic Centralism"
CSA_politics_desc:0 "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government. A Central Committee over Congress was voted in, and they shall have the final say on policy changes. Only reactionaries and traitors should fear us."
CSA_communist_party:0 "Ban Wall-to-wall elections"
CSA_communist_party_desc:0 "Despite our centralisation of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, AFL, KoL and all the acronyms squabble. Don't they realize the Vanguard is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship:0 "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc:0 "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeoisie thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed. How else can anything take its place, if we tolerate the past? Their actions are treason, and the Committee the judge."
CSA_fosters_economics:0 "Foster's Economic Policy"
CSA_fosters_economics_desc:0 "William Z Foster has managed to successfully push through his radical policies, as outlined in his manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America." Foster has immediately called for mass nationalisation of all industries and natural resources, as well as a series of radical reforms to, and protections of some unions."
CSA_resource_nationalization:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
CSA_resource_nationalization_desc:0 "The establishment of a truly American Syndicalist government will require the confiscation of large landed estates in every Union State. Including the whole body of forests, mineral deposits, lakes, and so on. No longer will Americans be under the yoke of the bourgeoisie."
CSA_union_managment:0 "Protect Craft Unions"
CSA_union_managment_desc:0 "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy. But they do not of themselves actually lead the production, this being the responsibility of the government economic organs. Our loyal Craft Unions gladly comply with close local and national supervision from the Party to protect their rights from mob rule."
CSA_collective_farming:0 "Green Fields Program"
CSA_collective_farming_desc:0 "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition. This program places land that was either seized or set aside for state use to the lowest bidder who promises the highest yield."
CSA_decentralized_planning:0 "Socialist Self-Management"
CSA_decentralized_planning_desc:0 "The Central Committee will immediately proceed with the difficult task of creating an adequate supply of reliable technicians and managers for the industries.

CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ:0 "Centralized Syndicalism"
CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc:0 "The Proletarian revolution initiates changes more rapid and far-reaching than any in the whole history of mankind. The hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, smashing their chains of slavery, will construct a society of liberty and intelligent prosperity. Syndicalism will inaugurate a new era for the human race, the building of a new world."
CSA_browders_economics:0 "Browder's Economic Policy"
CSA_browders_economics_desc:0 "Earl Russell Browder has managed to successfully introduce a series of policies meant to forge a stable, predictable economy. Built mainly on industrial plans and the direct control of several sectors of the economy by the state, through the use of commissariats and quotas. The Committee and the Craft Unions in Congress have received it well."
CSA_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
CSA_price_controls_desc:0 "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
CSA_control_unions:0 "Dismantle the IWW"
CSA_control_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."
CSA_state_farms:0 "Collective Farms"
CSA_state_farms_desc:0 "The State agriculture organisation is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry. Crops are sold either directly to the government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the open local markets."
CSA_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
CSA_state_quotas_desc:0 "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilisation of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles. The Committee has refused the idea of awards for meeting quotes, stating that advancement in the economy should be a reward, not an expectation."
CSA_planned_economy:0 "Browder's Anticapitalist Society"
CSA_planned_economy_desc:0 "Browder's Committee has approved a national plan, which declares a total economic war against the forces of monarchism and reaction. Therefore, industrial decision-making shall be socialized. Exemplar facilities will be observed as schools for uplifting others, while failing facilities will be required to adjust or be liquidated."
CSA_defend_the_revolution:0 "Defend the Revolution"
CSA_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "All the forces of capital and reaction are conspiring to destroy the new order. We face not just a war of ideals, but a war of bloody sabotage and shady subterfuge, one that must be won at all cost. Traitors in our own midst thankfully can be prosecuted."
CSA_revolutionary_guards:0 "Revolutionary Guards"
CSA_revolutionary_guards_desc:0 "Exercising our new authority in order to crush terrorists, counterrevolutionaries and traitors will require the creation of new, well-structured military and law enforcement agencies, not any wayward Red Guards or crazed vigilantes."
CSA_state_media:0 "The Revolution Will Be Broadcast"
CSA_state_media_desc:0 "The Daily Worker, Hollywood, and now the radio have all been seized by the Artists' Congress by the CC's graces. Under the tutelage of such illuminary socialist thinkers such as Hemingway, Welles, and Hughes, all the world will know of the American Socialist revolution."
CSA_create_the_cia:0 "Create the CIA"
CSA_create_the_cia_desc:0 "In order to defeat the class enemies of the revolution, we have laid the groundwork for a Combined Intelligence Agency, managed directly by the ruling committee.

CSA_purge_reactionaries:0 "Purge Reactionaries"
CSA_purge_reactionaries_desc:0 "In no country was culture so debased by capitalism as in the United States. Essentially a gigantic effort to perpetuate the robbery of the workers. Sterile, hypocritical, lifeless. The proletarian revolution in the United States has at once made a slash into the maze of hypocrisy and intellectual rubbish, paving the road for a glorious new America."

CSA_the_first_draft_desc:0 "It seems that despite the enthusiasm for the ideals of the revolution, fewer men than we would have liked have volunteered to leave their homes and families for an uncertain future on the front lines. An executive order from President Reed that a draft be instituted has therefore been drafted"
CSA_creating_cohesion:0 "Political Officers"
CSA_creating_cohesion_desc:0 "Our militiamen are enthusiastic, but they lack an education in the finer points of socialist theory.

CSA_the_long_haul:0 "The Long War"

CSA_baptism_by_fire:0 "Reactivate The Army War College"
CSA_baptism_by_fire_desc:0 "The Army War College in Pennsylvania was closed at the start of the war for its potential to serve as a hotbed of pro-federal sentiment and reaction. Now however we see that there may be some value in making use of its facilities, to educate the officers of the New America."
CSA_reform_the_cavalry:0 "Re-create The Cavalry"
CSA_reform_the_cavalry_desc:0 "The US cavalry was rejected by the revolution as an aristocratic institution and an outmoded one on the battlefield.

CSA_standardize_unit_sizes:0 "Standardize Unit Sizes"
CSA_standardize_unit_sizes_desc:0 "Our Red Guard militia forces have done well to take us this far, but their irregular numbers, often simply based on however many willing men can be found in a given town, hamper their ability in the field. By creating a standard unit size and redistributing troops from unit to unit in order to meet it we can enforce some uniformity in our ranks."
CSA_field_canon:0 "The Red Dragon"
CSA_field_canon_desc:0 "The 240mm Howitzer, nicknamed the "Red Dragon" by our troops, is the latest in heavy field guns for use by our army.

CSA_reactivate_the_officer_corps_desc:0 "While military order has been well-maintained so far reports indicate that many divisions are still electing their own officers.

## Constitutional Convention ###

csa.1.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention begins"
csa.1.d:0 "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. Initial controversy erupts as the AFL brought their own delegation in spite of orders from the IWW to let them represent the whole of industrial labor. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor and National Civic Federation. The most important of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organization, represented by Earl Browder and William Foster, represent a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."
csa.1.a:0 "Loyalists to the old order are not invited!"

csa.2.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - System of Government"
csa.2.d:0 "The AFL has made a splash in what many had expected to be a landslide victory for the IWW. What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn a line in the sand. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho syndicalist government with all legislative vested in the industrial trade unions. These unions seek to abolish membership fees, and elect representatives via wall-to-wall bargaining unit elections. The AFL argues that America should be a socialist state with power vested in local Councils of Professional Workers. The AFL claims representatives would be elected via seniority, with full voting rights given to only citizenry that have spent some years paying dues and serving their fellow man. TUUL Representative William Foster spoke in favor of the IWW, stating 'seniority and paying to vote is no different than graft, which is something a vanguard of syndicalism cannot support'. Foster's impassioned speech, if it leads to the IWW's legislation passing, could signal a shift in support for the TUUL over the IWW."

Reminding members of the Convention of the Court's track record for legalizing oppression of unions and downright reactionary laws, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remarked that preserving an unelected position of final legal decision could lead to authoritarianism. To the surprise of many, Earl Browder of the TUUL dissented, arguing that this discrimination was the result of a corrupt party system, and not an inherent flaw in the U.S. Constitution. To Browder, removing the Supreme Court would endanger the unity of the nation, and lead to more schisms as had happened in the Soviet Union. The AFL have quietly dissented with their vanguardist cohort, and pledge to support Flynn if her resolution passes."

csa.7.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Status of the President"
csa.7.d:0 "A surge of unaligned delegates has attempted to leave for recess several times to no avail. It appears that the issue of Executive power has met an impasse, and a decision must be made before the delegates starve in indecision. On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a totally anarcho syndicalist government requires there not to be an executive officer. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Thomas suggests a weak head of state position. The opposition is another cooperation of the AFL and TUUL who wish for a strong face to represent America. A leader without the means, argue they, could never save America as Reed did without power. Norman Thomas has condemned the AFL for what he sees as a 'boulangist coup' perpetrated by the AFL and TUUL to revive the old federal government. John L Lewis of the AFL rises to object, saying 'subordination to the IWW programme is no different than a single party state'. "

csa.8.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Centralisation or Decentralisation"
csa.8.d:0 "The Convention, after resuming, has found themselves more divided than ever. The core of the IWW has galvanized into a stricter dogma that pushes for the remaining articles to protect against tyranny of a central government. Demanding protection through the lifetime assurance of union membership and compounding social security with lifelong employment. Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism. In response, the AFL have been swayed by TUUL to emphasize the 'Dignity of Labor' in government. This argument rebukes Industrial Unionism with Craft Unionism, where the right to fair wages for fair work done replaces the IWW's goal of the abolition of wages. Browder again takes the stage calling to protect craft unionism, as it prevents a 'tyranny of the 51% over the 49%' in union elections."

More-over, Reed emphasized his role was to see the country through to the revolution, but a new leader needs to lead it now. Of the attendees at the Congress, two have gained the most prominence. One is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn of the IWW, who has begun a national campaign to excite voters for a possible female president - namely herself. The other is Norman Thomas who has led SPA delegates to work with Social Democrats to pledge votes to him. There is an understanding that even though this position of leadership is interim until the election, it still will allow either president to exert a great deal of influence over the country's groundwork."

csa.12.t:0 "Trial of the America First Party"
csa.12.d:0 "With the Revolution over, the time comes now to deal with those that fought against us. Huey Long, so according to Earl Browder, could have been a great ally to socialism. We do admit that Long's plan for welfare was in the right direction, but his authoritarian practice was abhorrent. As Long's family and close associates are now in exile, we'll have to make due with putting the leaders that remain in chains. Francis Townsend has defended the actions of the AFP's core membership, saying that the radical militarism was due to the nature of Southern Populism, not Huey Long-ism. Some in the jury have been swayed, but the final decision is to......"

The charges against, among other former Federalist politicians Douglas MacArthur. that of seizing the government and suspending civil rights in defence of conservative Democrats. Henry Morganthau Jr. has appeared in MacArthur's stead, due to his recent exile. Representing the business and social interest of the old regime, Morganthau stated that it was only under MacArthur that the mob violence against Jews committed by the AFP was halted. The testimony of MacArthur's reluctance to accept extra-legal power, and his personal accounts of admiring the socialist Jamex Coxey has swayed some. Ultimately, the jury has decided to....."
csa.13.a:0 "Pardon the Federal leaders."
csa.13.b:0 "Convict the Federal leaders."
csa.13.c:0 "Seize and arrest all regime supporters."

csa.14.t:0 "Avant-Guard Film"
csa.14.d:0 "Avant-guard art forms are not inherently a political tool, but the artists have shown an overwhelming support for the SPA in 1936. From the surrealists in New York shocking viewers with graphic sex on screen, to the Dadaists who challenge the very concept of popular art. As part of this movement, many of the country thousands of movie theaters have been expropriated to ensure that work of this caliber is not censored by prudish theater owners. They are brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theater. Theaters are part of the new revolutionary government to indicate the values and programs to the scattered populace of America particularly the rural regions of the country."
csa.14.a:0 "Make sure kids don't see the surrealist films."

csa.15.t:0 "Art Deco versus Modernism"
csa.15.d:0 "For most of the 1920s and 1930s the Art Deco art style was the dominant style of architecture and from coast to coast buildings were built in the Art Deco style. However, a number of revolutionary architects within the SPA wish to break away from that style and seek a more Modernist style inspired by the designs coming out of France, Italy, or Britain. The AFL have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims. The AFL point to Diego Rivera's recent demolition of the Rockefeller Center artwork, after his modification of chiseling the faces of Marx and Lenin over Zeus and Thor were decried as being in poor taste. Which style shall be supported?"
csa.15.a:0 "Preserve Art Deco."
csa.15.b:0 "Modernism."

csa.16.t:0 "Debates over Union Membership Fees and Racism"
csa.16.d:0 "What sounded like a simple proposition during the revolution, that of abolishing segregation, has run into numerous potholes. Starting with the debate over whether union membership fees were inherently discriminatory towards black workers. Evidence on both sides appears inconclusive, and most of the unions that were rejected from the Constitutional Convention have protested in favour a maximum union membership fee. These protesters claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain. Ultimately the IWW have persevered in Congress, and publicly shamed the new Congressmen and protesters as reactionaries."
csa.16.a:0 "We shall not give in to more racists in disguise!"

csa.17.t:0 "The Rise of Women-Only Unions"
csa.17.d:0 "Since the revolution, more and more women are entering into politics and technical fields. While in certain states the transition to womens' liberation has gone smoothly, in other places the wave is impeded. A national poll has shown the number of womens-only unions have quadrupled in the past year. When interviewed, these Womens-Only Unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Womens' Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of womens liberation. [CSA.GetLeader] has settled the debate by decrying both Womens-Only Unions and the systematic discrimination, arguing that 'there are people to blame on both sides for discrimination'."
csa.17.a:0 "The Revolutionary Man and Woman are equals."

csa.18.t:0 "Redistributing Corporate Wealth"
csa.18.d:0 "One of the few things Reed had agreed with the villainous Long on is wealth redistribution. Reed's wartime rationing has given way to a peace-time legislation to prevent the robber baronies he had fought all his life. This is enacted in the form of his final wishes to Congress, the expropriation of all assets owned by a single person in excess of $10 million USD. [CSA.GetLeader] has taken this one step further to decry the idea of corporations, and has threatened to declare the legal concept of corporations to be illegal. The very next day, the state offices were inundated with hundreds if not thousands of formal requests to dissolve corporations into their component businesses, and applications for new Consortium's in the same breath. It is obvious to [CSA.GetLeader] that this is just a ploy for the robber barons to hide their business practices from the government, and has ordered a moratorium on reclassification until wealth redistribution is over."
csa.18.a:0 "You won't get away that easy."

csa.19.t:0 "Land Redistribution Clashes with local Warlords"
csa.19.d:0 "From the mansions of the Rockefeller, the Morgans, the Carnegies, and the Vanderbilts, to the sharecroppers who run company stores. The land of the United States still belongs to the capitalist. The worst example being Murphy Ranch out in California, which was a hive of Silver Shirt activity during the war, and took months to starve out by our forces. It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor, and held onto a large estate for it's warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene. The program seems to be working however, so there is no reason to reconsider."
csa.19.a:0 "Who would've thought, warlords?"

csa.20.t:0 "Prisons Overflowing with Reactionaries"
csa.20.d:0 "Nobody could have expected our crime and punishment system would become so overstuffed as to require this decision. The numerous small schisms in the SPA has left our government with it's fair share of detractors, as well as the expected resistance. Thousands upon thousands are being fed, clothed and housed on our dime for their crimes against the people. Our more reform minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary though, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come. The Catholic Workers Movement strongly disagree, and claim that exile and life elsewhere is the most Christian thing to do."
csa.20.a:0 "Execute the traitors of high standing."
csa.20.b:0 "Take the workingmen into work-camps."
csa.20.c:0 "Exile them to Canada and Mexico."

csa.21.t:0 "Education Revolution"
csa.21.d:0 "A notable professor out of John Hopkins University by the name of John Dewey has been appointed Secretary of Education. In Dewey's eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a per-determined set of skills, but rather the realisation of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. In particular he emphasizes that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'. Dewey's detractors, notably the Catholic Workers Movement, claim his polities are antagonistic to religious education. Ultimately [CSA.GetLeader] has decided to endorse Dewey's reforms."
csa.21.a:0 "Towards a New Generation."

csa.22.t:0 "The President Uncovers the Greater Business Plot"
csa.22.d:0 "[CSA.GetLeader] and the Attorney General appeared to Congress today to allege that they uncovered a connection between the corporations that supported Huey Long, MacArthur, and the Pacific States. This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of either MacArthur, the PSA or Long winning, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. Many Congressmen worry that punishing the medical profession will harm the life expectancy of the CSA. An alternate proposal for these corporations to be collectivized and their members rehabilitated and let free."
csa.22.a:0 "Small sacrifice for a future without capitalism."
csa.22.b:0 "We shall have them rehabilitated."

csa.23.t:0 "Resistance to social changes"
csa.23.d:0 "In an attempt to observe the changes in society that socialism is building. Congress has approved of a roaming documentary to film the new America, so that the world may know our progress. The film was shown to Congress to shock and revulsion, with scenes government propaganda defaced, continued social barring of women from workplaces, and a union representative charging a black worker nearly five times the going rate for union membership. The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation. These unpopular Congressmen were then ejected from the building."
csa.23.a:0 "Reactionaries will be dealt with!"

csa.24.t:0 "Family Code of [GetYear]"
csa.24.d:0 "With the social revolution in full swing, Congress has passed the Family Code of [GetYear]. The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect.\n\nThus to that end the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidized. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, as well as decriminalizing homosexual behaviour. A Committee of Sexology, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, Wilhelm Reich, Harry Hay and Alain Leroy Locke are still locked in debate over how to approach this."

While the public at large was fooled by this display, the Vanguard party is not so easily deceived. President [CSA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social klansmen disguised to deceive the working class.'

With the ascension of William Z Foster comes a dedication to the dream to create a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress.

Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen have smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation. Townsend was immediately arrested in the first bugged hotel room he stayed in, and has become the main attraction in the largest Union Trial in American history.

It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary.

csa.73.t:0 "Foster dissolves the AFL"
csa.73.d:0 "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labor leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labor by adoption industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence, allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labor."

Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy.

It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes to no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."

### General Flavor Event

csa.76.t:0 "Primer of God Save King Billy"
csa.76.d:0 "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save King Billy, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save King Billy is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."
csa.76.a:0 "Chaplin has out done himself."

csa.77.t:0 "The Catholic Workers Movement"
csa.77.d:0 "While a good number of religious Americans have protested the effects of the revolution, that is not true for all groups. Of these groups the one that have attracted the most attention and popularity recently the Catholic Workers Movement. Lead by Comrade Dorothy Day, the movement has attracted popularity for combining Catholicism with socialist values. They focus on the concept of Works of Mercy as well as have built a number of Hospitality Houses in major cities. The Hospitality Houses are acting as support shelters for those trying to return to civilian life now that the revolution has come to fruition."
csa.77.a:0 "Live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ."

csa.78.t:0 "Grapes of Wrath Primer"
csa.78.d:0 "Today the film Grapes of Wrath premiered in theaters today. The film is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed patriotic author John Steinbeck. The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The titual Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public as a necessary edit."
csa.78.a:0 "A film for the masses."

csa.79.t:0 "The People's Conservation Committee"
csa.79.d:0 "Since the 1916 National Park Service Act, Americans have been able to preserve natural splendor safe from industrialisation. Since the revolution has now been achieved, a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees the Midwest, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."
csa.79.a:0 "And it puts people to work to boot."

csa.80.t:0 "Revolutionary Memorials"
csa.80.d:0 "With the revolution now over, countless memorials have gone up throughout the country to honour the sacrifice of the men and women that made this possible. While many honour those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honoring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honoring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing, and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and are honoring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."
csa.80.a:0 "Everyone shall be honored, unless they were bombers."

csa.81.t:0 "Cure for Polio"
csa.81.d:0 "Dr. Jonas Salk has created a cure for Polio. This is a miracle cure that many are calling a breakthrough in modern science. The scourge of Polio in America will now be forever gone from the minds of Americans. Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
csa.81.a:0 "Thank you Dr. Salk."

csa.82.t:0 "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
csa.82.d:0 "A question has come up in regards to the Boy scouts of America. Some within congress regard it as a more reactionary organisation, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organisation should be created similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organisation will be for both boys and girls and supported by the government, and help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down."
csa.82.a:0 "Leave it alone."
csa.82.b:0 "Create the Pioneers of America."

csa.83.t:0 "American Artists' Congress"
csa.83.d:0 "The American Artist Congress is an organisation that has been created to unite artistic people around the country and help promote the arts within America. From traditional artwork to film-making all are supported within the artists' congress. It quickly has become a popular organisation to show the new advent-guard art of the revolution. Their Chairman, Ernest Hemingway, has already begun a plan for a series of patriotic publications on life during the revolution. Ernest Hemmingway's appointment to Chairman has caused some backlash from artists like John Dos Passos and John Steinbeck, who claim Ernest's politics have turned authoritarian in recent years due to his work in producing propaganda for the 1936 US election."

csa.85.t:0 "Paul Robeson Takes A World Tour"
csa.85.d:0 "The hiatus Paul Robeson took from acting to pursue social causes in the past year has greatly expanded his popularity. With a powerful voice and strong support for international Syndicalism, Robeson has become the Marian Anderson of socialists in America. Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for African American rights to Europe. His stops include the Union of Britain, Commune of France, and the SRI. These European audiences, while in contact with the wider world, still find the attraction of black singers to be exotic."
csa.85.a:0 "Bon Voyage Robeson."

csa.86.t:0 "Promoting Sewer Socialism"
csa.86.d:0 "In the old days of the Socialist Party, successes were measured by how clean your sewer system was. Especially in Wisconsin, where Morris Hillquit made it his campaign promise to clean up the city. In reforming and organizing public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganize systems without having to redefine or destroy the foundations of the system. That principle of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation, now that the chains are broken. Many cities such as Pittsburgh are filled with pollution that fills the skies, now that the revolution is over, cities all across the country shall be cleaned up and modernized. We hope the international community can appreciate a clean sewer as much as it does a skyscraper."

csa.88.d:0 "Within the deep south in Stone Mountain lies a massive bas-relief carving of three Confederate figures, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The site was also the rebirth of Ku Klux Klan. Many wish to remove such a blight, especially as other monuments to the Confederacy are torn down. However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief. Some believe that it should be destroyed. \n\nJames Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to chisel down the Confederates and replace them with Jemmy, John Brown, George Padmore. These being the leaders of African-American emancipation he feels best inspire the new America.\n\nDiego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honorable compromise. The relief is to be re-chiseled down to replace the Confederates with the leaders of Socialist revolution. Those being Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and John Reed. "

csa.89.t:0 "Syndicalist Ethics" #Suicide is legal
csa.89.d:0 "With the onset of a new society, a new set of ethics must take the place of the old ones. What is truly ethical behaviour? Waging revolution by all means. Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years or persecution. This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose soul suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretense to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalize murder so long as it looks like suicide. Foster's cabinet has called him in to reconsider, but the ultimate result was....."
csa.89.a:0 "Foster backs down."
csa.89.b:0 "Foster wins them over."

csa.90.t:0 "The USA Trilogy by John Dos Passos"
csa.90.d:0 "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit comes together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of illegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. Dos Passos has defended this inclusion, saying that the truth in art as he shows it must still exist even if it is bleak. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemmingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress."

csa.90.b:0 "Hemmingway is right."

csa.91.t:0 "Union Vacations"
csa.91.d:0 "With the revolution one of the changes that has come is the transformation in terms of vacations. The workers of America rarely got to enjoy all the luxuries that were created and the progressives would say 'belonged to the people'. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visiting the national parks when they had to work as many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."
csa.91.a:0 "Culture belongs to the people."

csa.92.t:0 "The Family and Freedom Program"
csa.92.d:0 "Our workers in the factories need to be free from distractions, our revolutionary soldiers must not be burdened with unnecessary worries about the well-being of their family. As part of the program to ensure that the American worker is relieved of responsibilities which President Foster has termed "A millstone about the neck of the workers" Today the first train from Chicago to the rural plains in the centre of our country has left with children from mothers and fathers who work in important positions in the industrial heartland. The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labor and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USAS, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."

csa.102.a:0 "A poor decision on their part."

### Military ###

csa.126.t:0 "Boldness in Science"
csa.126.d:0 "From the bold new class of scientists our generation has produced, none can match the imagination of our Oppenheimer and Pasons. Oppenheimer the ambitious physicist with a connection to the brightest minds in the Internationale can make the atomic weapon dream a reality. Pasons the liberated rocketry pioneer whose devotion to socialism is only matched by his devotion to advancing rocketry research. Unfortunately, we can only fully fund one of these due to budgetary concerns."
csa.126.a:0 "We shall be liberated from the earth."
csa.126.b:0 "We shall liberate the atom."

csa.127.t:0 "No Longer Chained To The Earth"
csa.127.d:0 "Despite his unorthodox lifestyle, Jack Parsons has made hasty work of completing a rocket to our specifications. We've had to hold back many objections from politicians claiming that Jack Parsons is secretly in a cult with his work associates. Easily dismissed hogwash, until a meeting held with the team late into production. Parsons surprised everyone with a film of a successful rocket takeoff ahead of schedule, but then dropped a bombshell by asking that his rocket be used primarily for scientific exploration of outer space. This incredible news is still being mulled over by the Committee, with their decision dictating the future of the program."
csa.127.a:0 "Parsons is off, proceed as planned."
csa.127.b:0 "Parsons request is accepted."

csa.128.t:0 "The Atomic Chain Broken"
csa.128.d:0 "An international cooperation resulted in fantastic progress on the nuclear weapon. The biggest hurdle came when none of the Southwestern states would allow a test of such importance on their land, due to public knowledge of nuclear radiation. We've had to settle for an old munitions test site in West Virginia. There the test was made, and the entire Internationale celebrated this occasion."
csa.128.a:0 "We hold the future now."

csa.129.t:0 "America is Liberated"
csa.129.d:0 "At long last all of America is now part of the [CSA.GetNameDef]. The revolution has achieved its a major victory and the people have been unshackled from the chains of capitalism. All our waving the red flag of socialism from California to New York Island. While the scars of the revolution are everywhere we can look forward to bringing the revolution to everyone."
csa.129.a:0 "This land is your land."

csa.130.t:0 "Overtures from [From.GetNameDef]"
csa.130.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has arrived, offering a treaty of friendship between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef], suggesting that two countries with so much in common should work together rather than be at odds."
csa.130.a:0 "They are wise."
csa.130.b:0 "We have no use for Americans, syndicalist or otherwise."

csa.131.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
csa.131.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new era of co-operation between our nations."
csa.131.a:0 "Excellent."

csa.132.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
csa.132.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps both our nations being part of the revolution is not enough for them."
csa.132.a:0 "A poor decision on their part."

csa.150.t:0 "Illinois General Assembly Invites the IWW"
csa.150.d:0 "The state legislature of Illinois has invited the IWW to discuss the current crisis and the looming deadline issued by the federal governmnet. Jack Reed accepted this offer, and held an informal meeting with several trade union leaders prior. Reed made it clear that the situation was dire, and the SPA would need to unite behind the IWW in order to survive the coming conflict. This silent agreement meant that the traditional SPA leadership would be reorganized along Industrial Unionist lines, with each union representative allowed a single vote. The SPA immediately and unanimously pledged their support for a social revolution through direct action, not diplomacy."
csa.150.a:0 "So Say We All!"

csa.151.t:0 "Jack Reed Declares the [GetMonth] Revolution "
csa.151.d:0 "In the Illinois General Assembly, Reed delivered a firey broadcast describing the wealth of America and the Syndicates. Declaring that direct action against capitalist society was a vital necessity for all Americans, and that the federal government's deadline must not only be ignored it must be defied. Telegrams from the Third International poured in to support Reed's SPA, exciting the attendants. A vote was called to begin reforming the American capitalist economy into an anarcho-syndicalist economy. This referendum, signed by the attendants, declared the Federal Reserve null and void. The IWW was appointed the labor chamber for the new syndicalist government, and the selling of comapny shares declared illegal. The representatives, satisfied with thier success, have returned to Chicago to organize the armed revolution."
csa.151.a:0 "E pluribus unum."

csa.152.t:0 "General Strike Moves on the Federal Reserve"
csa.152.d:0 "The General Strike, whose goal has been to protect workers from federal tyranny, now moves to seize the means of production. The Red Guard have ordered an evacuation of lower Manhattan, in order to both seize the gold in the Federal Reserve Bank as well as dismantle Wall Street. In this delegation were reporters, who were allowed to watch congressmen carry safe boxes away for safekeeping in Chicago. These items are put under the trust of the IWW, whom have elected Norman Thomas as their under-secretary. Several SPA politicans were arrested in Washington D.C for meeting outside the Eccles Building, ordering the Federal Reserve Chairman Eugene Black to hear their petitons."
csa.152.a:0 "Release those men now!"

csa.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
csa.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Reed's supporters, Red Guards have been raised in large numbers and a growing determination to see the country remade in a syndicalist image by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they see no path to compromise."
csa.153.a:0 "It is only a matter of time."

csa.154.t:0 "Reconcile with the CSA?"
csa.154.d:0 "Against all odds, [CSA.GetNameDef] has triumphed against all opposition, radically transforming America overnight. From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centered around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at is core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, the [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed, before the victors turn their eyes towards California."
csa.154.a:0 "Yes, let us end this ruinous war. (Play as the CSA)"
csa.154.b:0 "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

csa.155.t:0 "America is Reunited!"
csa.155.d:0 "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
csa.155.a:0 "From Sea to Shining Sea!"

csa.156.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
csa.156.d:0 "With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, many in [Root.GetNameDef] hoped the rebel government to the west would prove amenable to a peaceful end to the conflict that's ravaged America. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington and New Orleans it had replaced. It seems that once again, force of arms will be needed to reunite the shattered pieces of the country."
csa.156.a:0 "America one day shall be reunited."

### Resistance Events ###

csa.200.t:0 "Longist Bombing"
csa.200.d:0 "Supporters of Huey Long and his ideals have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."

#CSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

CSA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In 1898 'The Fighting Quaker' Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps to join the American force in the Spanish-American war. Due to his high education level he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration. When the situation started to deteriorate, Butler decided to resign from his post and presented his services to the Socialist Party, becoming the highest ranking military official to join the Red Guard and earning the rank of Field Marshal."
CSA_EVANS_CARLSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 26, 1896, in Sidney, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Congregationalist minister, Evans Carlson began his military career in 1912 when he left High School and signed up for the US Army as a private, serving in the Philippines and Hawaii, and finishing his four years of service in 1916 as a Sargeant. He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant, and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 at Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933, and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. As the Nation spiralled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions, and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."
CSA_MAURICE_ROSE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 26, 1899, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Maurice Rose, born into a Jewish family, lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard in 1916 with the hopes of being able to join Pershing's Punitive Expedition to Mexico, but was discharged six weeks later for being underage. He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923, and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanisation officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armored warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognized by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanized warfare expert in the Syndicates' army\n\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumoured to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."
CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 7, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks, and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Jack Reed announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Edward Allen Carter Jr. was born to a Black American father and an East Indian mother, who shortly after his birth moved to India. With the collapse of the British Empire, and the proclamation of the Bharatiya Commune, Carter came into contact with socialism for the first time as a child, although it was short lived as his parents would move again in 1932, this time to Shanghai, where he tried to join the local American garrison, only to be rejected on account of his young age.\n\nWith the American Civil War brewing in the distance, he travelled to America as a stowaway in one of the Legation's transports, reaching Seattle and joining the local branch of the Red Guard. As their numbers discreetly mobilized eastwards to start the revolution, Carter slowly became popular amongst the soldiers, retelling the stories of bravery and revolution he had seen in his infancy in East India. When the Revolution finally started, Carter was voted in as a General, becoming the one of the only black members of the CSA staff along with Oliver Law.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Federalist Faction."
CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 5, 1915, in Webster Groves, Missouri\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Ham Cannon attended the Culver Military Academy before entering the University of Michigan in 1934 to become a Mechanical Engineer. In Michigan, he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps program, with the specific purpose of joining the Marine Corps. It was there he further developed his knowledge of warfare. However, the outbreak of the civil war disrupted his training and his studies. With many of his fellow classmates being recruited by the Syndicate Red Guards, Cannon decided to follow them into the Red Guard. As the officers were voted to fill the staff of the syndicates, Cannon was chosen as a CO of Michigan's divisions. After a short inspection of the available candidates by Smedley Butler, Butler selected Cannon personally to be promoted to General and has been trying to help the young officer perfect his Marine officer training."
CSA_BENJAMIN_KATINE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 7, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Benjamin Katine, a mechanic and electrician of some renown in New York, joined the Industrial Workers of the World militias as soon as they started recruitment. Becoming popular amongst the automobile unions, he was voted as an officer in February 1937, and was chosen by the Central Staff as a general. Despite the Automotive unions backing his position, Katine still has a lot to learn before becoming a valuable general for the CSA\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Unionist Faction."
CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 9, 1901, in San Francisco, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Patrick Murphy graduated from the California State University in 1926 as a Radio Engineer and moved to San Francisco. While he was unremarkable in the major unrest of the 1930s, he joined the Red Guard after the 1936 election, where his mechanical expertise with radios allowed him to connect the workers of California with those of Chicago. As the workers were discreetly mobilized into Chicago, Murphy was assigned to several cities across what now is the Syndicalist stronghold, improving radio communications between the Red Guard detachments. For his service, he was granted the rank of General within the Red Guard, but even many within the CSA General Staff doubt this Radio Engineer will be capable of leading vast armies across the American landscape."
CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W John Tisa comes from a Cuban-Italian immigrant family. Previously working mostly as a factory worker and as an amateur writer in his spare time, Tisa joined the Red Guard the 31st of December, 1936. Since then, he has earned the respect of the Syndicalist soldiers in New Jersey, and was voted as their CO at their staff elections. Tisa was then promoted to general, where, for better or worse, he will have to learn from scratch the art of warfare if he hopes to come out ahead of the enemy during the revolution."
CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 23, 1900, in Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Oliver Law enlisted to the US Army in 1919 as a private, serving with the 24th Infantry regiment stationed on the Mexican Border. He left the military in 1925 after being refused any kind of promotion on the basis of his skin color, moving first to to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked at a cement plant and then shortly thereafter to Chicago where he drove a cab for the Yellow Cab Company. When the Great Depression hit, Law was left unemployed for years, until he managed to become a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen's Association. With his savings, he tried to open a restaurant in 1932 but ultimately failed and unemployed once more, he joined the International Labor Defence. With a Civil War looming over the United States, Law was amongst the first to volunteer for the Red Guard. Because of his military background and leadership skills, he was quickly voted in as an officer by his fellow soldiers, before later reaching the rank of General thanks to the sponsoring of the National Negro Congress.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Loyal Member of the Unionist Faction, and he is rumoured to keep close relations with both Bayard Rustin and Asa Philip Randolph."
CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
