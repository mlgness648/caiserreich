worldnews.1.d.all:0 "To those not in the know, it might seem like the crisis in the United States came out of nowhere, but experts agree that this was a civil war years in making. Since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1925 the economy of the United States has been sluggish and mired in deep recession.\nNow, the United States has collapsed into an all-out civil war between the supporters of the Federal Government, the Combined Syndicates of America, the right-wing American Union State, and the remnants of democratic rule in the Pacific States of America. Volunteers are pouring in from around the world to support one faction or another, with some characterising the bitter ideological conflict as simply part of a wider global clash of ideals."

worldnews.2.surrender:0 "A few days ago a demand from the Commune of France was telegraphed to the Swiss government: cede the province of Haute-Savoie under threat of armed coercion. The French characterised their demand as a need to end the 'persecution of the French population' within the province. The Swiss government decided to avoid war and agreed, stating that a peaceful transfer of ownership was preferable to bloodshed.\n\nThis is a victory for the French government, which has already declared the reclamation of Haute-Savoie a victory for the world's working class."

worldnews.3.d:0 "Just twenty years ago, in the last years of the Weltkrieg, the Russian Empire collapsed, ripped apart by nationalist movements and divided between the Whites and the Reds. After a German intervention, the republican government defeated the Bolsheviks, but it appears that the Russian revolutionary spirit was not extinguished.\n\nAfter ineffective land reform by the Kerensky government and austerity measures to pay off the Brest-Litovsk reparations, as well as a crisis in the government after the President's assassination, the cities in the western part of the nation have been engulfed with the Red tide once more.

After over twenty years of proxy warfare, diplomatic pressure and political squabbles the uneasy peace between Germany and France has broken down. These two great powers are now mobilising their armies in preparation for a war the likes of which the world has never seen.\n\nNew guns, planes, ships, tanks and deadlier weapons still will see their first use on the battlefield as open warfare begins once more in Europe. For the Germans and the French now there can be only one end: Victory, or destruction."

Dubbed 'The Damocles Project', it is an extensive multi-nation study into the destructive power of nuclear fission with the intent of creating 'bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known'. The famous German physicist Albert Einstein had previously warned that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash.\n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, so naturally the whole world now knows. Some have dismissed the project as a childish fantasy, but many experts fear a breakthrough."

Plagued by disorder, political agitation and ineffective governance in recent years, the Republic lost the support of the people and state news agencies now report that a successor to Nicholas II has been crowned Tsar of all the Russians.\n\nWhile it is not known what the international priorities of this reborn Russian Empire are, or even if the coronation of the Tsar will calm the turbulent nation, numerous monarchs across the world have already congratulated the Romanovs on regaining their divine birth right."

The government of the Russian nation has announced their territorial ambitions, laying claim to almost all the territory of the former Russian Empire and making clear their willingness to resort to military force if needed.\n\nNumerous nations in Eastern Europe have already recalled their embassies in Russia, and the world is waiting for Germany's response to this blatant attack on her sphere of influence..."

worldnews.9.d:0 "Delegates from socialist nations and political movements around the world gathered in Paris today, for the latest in a series of World Congresses. While the mantle of the Third Internationale was taken up by the Communards after the Russian Civil War the ideological tenor of the event promises to be very different, with Syndicalist parties being the newly dominant force of the far left. Delegates were greeted by a military parade, an exhibition of Avant Garde art and finally a speech by the chairman of the CSP.\n\nAt the top of the agenda is the spread of the revolution to Asia and North America, ongoing conflict in Spain, policy on colonialism and the requirements for membership of the Third Internationale's military alliance."

The Union of Britain has declared its goal of spreading Syndicalism to the nearby state of Ireland, which prompted an intervention by the exiled British royalist government in Canada. The navies and air forces of both belligerents are already being mobilised, and the first shots have already been fired in the Irish Sea.\n\nExperts believe that the intensity of this conflict will be limited due to the large bodies of water separating the belligerents, but it has nevertheless raised world tensions to new heights."

worldnews.13.d:0 "British politician and former Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill has published a new book, part of an emerging genre known as \"alternate history\", and concerning the Great War.\n\nThe story takes the perspective of a young British soldier returning from a victorious Gallipoli campaign amid a world radically different from our own. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic. Churchill has commented that \"Something like this could have happened in another universe\"."

The Progressive platform Olson campaigned on drew unprecedented allies from both Democrats and Republicans seeking an alternative to the populists and partisan hacks that they saw as tearing apart the nation. Reinvigorated with the news that his stomach cancer is in remission, Olson boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary."

In an astonishing reversal of norms in post-Weltkrieg Europe, particularly for a country with such close ties to Germany, Mitteleuropa and the Reichspakt, the Dutch have even cut ties with the French government-in-exile in Algiers.\nThough the reason for this bizarre diplomatic volte-face was initially downplayed by the Dutch government, it was eventually leaked that the ruling CNA-LSP coalition had recognised the Commune in order to satisfy the socialists and save the Netherlands from political chaos. If true, such a bold action demonstrates the extraordinary measures some centrists are willing to take to prevent polarisation in modern Europe."

With the weakened Conservative CNA government having entered into coalition with the liberal VDB, it has engaged in a policy of negotiating with the Dutch Far Left and Right in order to stem domestic political catastrophe.\n\nTo bring the ultranationalist VNH on side, the Dutch government finally agreed to nationalise German assets in order to keep the administration from collapse - a situation the CNA-LSP sought to keep secret. Already there have been calls in Berlin for punitive measures, both economic and military. How the Empire will act however, none yet can guess."
