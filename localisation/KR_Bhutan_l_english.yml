bhutan.0.d:0 "Bhutan was always on the periphery of Great Britain’s sphere, and when the empire began to collapse, it remained firmly on the periphery. Following the establishment of a socialist republic in Bengal, Bhutanese statesman Sonam Topgye Dorji managed to negotiate a stable relationship with the Bharatiya Commune. Bhutan withdrew from their traditional claims in the Duars and recognized the Commune as an independent nation, and in return, the new syndicalist government in Calcutta continued the Raj’s pre-revolution economic investment and recognized the sovereignty of Bhutan. With the situation in India heating up, and instability in Bhutan’s close northern neighbour Tibet following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, the kingdom aims to stand as an island of peace and stability amidst this vast sea of chaos."
bhutan.0.a:0 "Interesting"

bhutan.1.t:0 "The Himalayan Powderkeg"
bhutan.1.d:0 "Since the reign of the great Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Bhutan has been ruled by the Zhabdrung reincarnations, who delegated temporal power to the Druk Desi, elected by the nobles, or penlops, and the Je Khenpo, elected by the monks. However, these two leaders have conspired over time to eliminate the power of the Zhabdrung, and by the nineteenth century the country was firmly in the hands of the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo. This Diarchy was further streamlined when the penlop of Trongsa, Ugyen Wangchuck, crushed his rivals and crowned himself a hereditary monarch in 1907. The kingdom saw a brief period of crisis at the death of King Ugyen in 1925, where, amongst the chaos of the Indian Revolution, two claimants, Ugyen’s son Jigme and the penlop of Paro Tshering Penjor, raced to crown themselves as his successor. With the help of Ugyen’s close political allies, the Dorji Family, Jigme managed to secure the throne and consolidate his power. However, with the power of the Dorji family waning, other political forces have risen to challenge Jigme’s rule. The newest reincarnation of the Zhabdrung has spent the last ten years building a base with which he challenge the king’s authority, and there are many within Bhutan who aim to profit from the king’s weakness."

bhutan.2.t:0 "The Pretender in Paro"
bhutan.2.d:0 "To the west of our capital lies Paro, granted to Tshering Penjor by the former King Ugyen, along with promises that Tshering Penjor would rule the kingdom following the late king’s death. Only the haste of Sonam Topgye Dorji in coronating the young prince Jigme Wangchuck prevented him from taking the throne for himself, and the noble has fumed in the west ever since. Tshering Penjor holds a small stockpile of firearms, as well as the late king Ugyen’s Raven Crown. While it is true that Tshering Penjor has served the king faithfully since Jigme beat him to the title, one can only wonder where his true loyalties lie. He has many allies within the more traditionalist penlops and key members of Bhutan’s limited armed forces, and serves as a rallying point for those in opposition of the king’s policies. However, with no wives or sons to speak of, it is generally thought that Tshering Penjor will die by the time Jigme’s son, Jigme Dorji, is of age to inherit the traditional seat of heirs to the kingdom at Paro."

Having presented these gifts to the king, Sonam Topgye immediately set about managing the affairs of the state. As the king’s minister, Sonam Topgye is the foremost ally of the Wangchuck family, and with their children betrothed to one another, it seems that Jigme aims to keep it that way. Though their power was the most disrupted by the Indian Revolution, the Dorji family remain the richest family in Bhutan, and aim to use that wealth for the benefit of the nation and the king, though many of the more conservative elements of Bhutan see their methods of reform to be outlandish and ill-designed."

While the Indian leader declined to support this insurrection, further rumours have spread claiming that there is a plot led by the supporters of the Zhabdrung which aims to secretly assassinate the King Jigme!

While Tshering Penjor has expressed his concern regarding the safety of such a meeting, Samten Jamtsho is adamant that the monks could guarantee the safety of the king.

While the majority of the monks here are repulsed by such an idea, in the absence of the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck, Samten Jamtsho is the highest monastic authority present, barring the Zhabdrung of course.

At the same time, official messengers spread word of the Zhabdrung’s tragic death of natural causes. Their reports mix accusations of the Zhabdrung’s infidelity and moral degradation with tales of King Jigme’s sorrowful mourning over the death of his rival and de-jure overlord.

He instead began to berate the young king, mixing insult with threat. As his tirade reached a fevered pitch, one of the king’s personal guards drew his blade and began to advance on the Zhabdrung, provoking a frenzied response from the young lama’s supporters. A large group of warriors, armed with knives and swords, fell upon the king and his entourage. Several of his guard fell to their blades, and the king himself only barely escaped, badly wounded. The king was taken immediately to his personal tent, and healers work desperately to bring him back from the brink of death.

The fight for the fortress was short, brutal, and bloody. All who opposed the royal forces were put to death. At the height of the fighting, the Zhabdrung was found hiding in his chamber and unceremoniously executed by some of Tshering Penjor's soldiers. The western penlop then brought the head out to the remainder of the late Zhabdrung’s supporters, and announced that they were free of the evil spirit’s spell.

bhutan.30.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Withdraws to Paro"
bhutan.30.d:0 "As more and more penlops and lords pledge their support for the new Wangchuck king, Tshering Penjor has once again withdrawn to his personal fiefdom in the west. He has refused all invitations to the capital and silently fumes in his palace at Paro. Tshering Penjor has not made any moves openly against the young Jigme Dorji, offering an opportunity to bury the hatchet between the rebellious lord and his liege. Some of the king’s advisers have suggested that a large gift could win over the support of Tshering Penjor, while others feel that the Paro penlop will come to terms of his own accord, realizing the futility of resisting the king."
bhutan.30.a:0 "Send him a caravan of Indian trade goods"
bhutan.30.b:0 "We do not need his support!"

bhutan.31.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Acquiesces"
bhutan.31.d:0 "Seeing the situation turn against him, Tshering Penjor has begrudgingly accepted Jigme Dorji as the legitimate king of Bhutan. While this promises a return to a sorely needed peace, the loyalty of Tshering Penjor towards the new administration is questionable at best. The western penlop certainly will not take this opportunity to begin sending taxes our way. With the nominal support of Tshering Penjor, however, the young king, and more importantly his regent, can begin to implement the reforms that the kingdom needs."
bhutan.31.a:0 "Peace at last"

bhutan.32.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Returns the Crown"
bhutan.32.d:0 "Seeing the situation turn against him, Tshering Penjor has begrudgingly accepted Jigme Dorji as the legitimate king of Bhutan, sending the young king the Raven Crown, so that he may undergo a formal coronation. This action promises a return to a sorely needed peace, and shows a commitment towards young Jigme Dorji that goes beyond his father. Some believe Tshering Penjor is angling to take a greater part in the young king’s upbringing and administration, while others feel that the penlop has grown tired of resisting the central authority. Regardless, the western penlop certainly will not take this opportunity to begin sending taxes our way. With the support of Tshering Penjor, however, the young king, and more importantly his regent, can begin to implement the reforms that the kingdom needs."
bhutan.32.a:0 "Peace at last"

bhutan.33.t:0 "Bhutanese Demands"
bhutan.33.d:0 "Through marriage, the Chogyal of Sikkim and the powerful Dorji clan of Bhutan were bound. Now, with Sonam Dorji as head of the Bhutanese civilian administration, Bhutan looks to restore the Chogyal, by necessity under the nominal sovereignty of the Bhutanese monarch. Bhutan has threatened war if its demands in Sikkim are not met."
bhutan.33.a:0 "Bhutan? We will crush them!"
bhutan.33.b:0 "We shall cede Sikkim"

bhutan.34.t:0 "Nepal Refuses"
bhutan.34.d:0 "Nepal has refused to cede control of Sikkim. We threatened the Nepalese with war should they refuse, we must back down or make good on our threat."
bhutan.34.a:0 "War it is then."
bhutan.34.b:0 "On second thought, back down."

bhutan.35.t:0 "Nepal Cedes Sikkim"
bhutan.35.d:0 "Surprisingly, Nepal has agreed to cede Sikkim. The Chogyal shall quickly be restored to his rightful position."
bhutan.35.a:0 "A happy sunrise."

bhutan.41.t:0 "An Opportunity"
bhutan.41.d:0 "Forced from his throne, the Chogyal of Sikkim found shelter in Bhutan, nominally swearing fealty to king Jigme. We have sought ever since to restore the Chogyal. Now, riots in Nepal have prompted New Delhi and the Commune alike to attack. With most of their forces undoubtedly engages against the Indians, now would be an opportune time, perhaps the only time, to attack Nepal."
bhutan.41.a:0 "Declare War!"
bhutan.41.b:0 "No, we must wait until we are stronger."

bhutan.42.t:0 "Bhutan Declares War"
bhutan.42.d:0 "Seeing an opportunity in the war with both Delhi and the Commune to restore the Chogyal of Sikkim, Bhutan has declared its own war upon us."
bhutan.42.a:0 "The hermit kingdom has claws."

bhutan.43.t:0 "Our Aims Met"
bhutan.43.d:0 "We have captured Sikkim. Considering Nepal's military might relative to ours, we may wish to sue for peace while we have the upper hand."
bhutan.43.a:0 "Seek peace."
bhutan.43.b:0 "Continue the fight."

bhutan.44.t:0 "Bhutan Seeks Peace"

bhutan.47.t:0 "Treaty of Calcutta"
bhutan.47.d:0 "The recent Indian National Congress and the appointment of Agrarian leader Mohandas Gandhi as head of the Calcutta government presented our nations an opportunity to reaffirm our commitments to one another. Sonam Topgye has travelled to Calcutta to meet with the Mahatma, drafting a new treaty of friendship. As an old associate of the Indian leader, Sonam Topgye Dorji was able to effectively negotiate a solid bilateral agreement between the two nations. Gandhi has promised increased Indian investment into the mountain kingdom and returned the lands around Deothang, in return for some political reforms and the legalization of the Bharatiya aligned Druk National Congress."
bhutan.47.a:0 "May there be peace in our time!"

bhutan.48.t:0 "Treaty of Calcutta"
bhutan.48.d:0 "The recent Indian National Congress, and the appointment of Moderate leader A. K. Fazlul Huq as head of the Calcutta government presented our nations an opportunity to reaffirm our commitments to one another. Sonam Topgye has travelled to Calcutta to meet with the Tiger of Bengal, drafting a new treaty of friendship. While initially negotiations began to stall out, they were salvaged by young moderate leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who developed a close bilateral agreement with Sonam Topgye Dorji. Mr. Nehru has promised increased Indian investment into the mountain kingdom, in return for political reforms and the legalization of the Bharatiya aligned Druk National Congress."

bhutan.49.t:0 "Indo-Bhutanese Relations Break Down"
bhutan.49.d:0 "In response to the recent appointment of Subhas Chandra Bose as chairman of the Indian National Congress, we have sent a group of advisers to meet with this new firebrand leader. Unfortunately, these diplomats have been turned away at the Indian border, which has significantly tightened following Bose’s ascension. It seems that the new chairman’s promise to cease all negotiations with ‘reactionary’ powers was more than just bark. We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
bhutan.49.a:0 "Tragic"
bhutan.49.b:0 "We will not be bullied by Bose and his thugs!"

bhutan.50.t:0 "Bose Breaks the Treaty of Calcutta"
bhutan.50.d:0 "After seizing power in the Commune, Subhas Chandra Bose has rapidly reversed the diplomatic agreements made between Sonam Topgye Dorji and his predecessor. Blasting these treaties as an example of his domestic opponents’ weakness, Bose has militarized the border and began turning away merchants and diplomats alike. We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
bhutan.50.a:0 "Tragic"

bhutan.51.t:0 "Direction for our Military"
bhutan.51.d:0 "While there are few in our government who do not believe that our military requires reform, the direction of that reform is a source of intense debate. Reform minded members of the court advocate for increased investment into the local militias of Bhutan, with the aim of strengthening its defence, while the traditionalist leader Namgyal Bahadur repeatedly calls for the creation of a small but effective central army."
bhutan.51.a:0 "We will create a small but effective army"
bhutan.51.b:0 "We will invest in our militias"

bhutan.52.t:0 "The National Assembly"
bhutan.52.d:0 "Gongzim and Regent Sonam Topgye Dorji has called for the creation of a National Assembly, to advise the king and provide a voice for more localized issues. While he has determined that such a council should be made up of twenty representative, presided over by a Dorji Gongzim, there still remains the issue of who exactly should fill these seats. With the assembly given the power to introduce recommendations to the reigning king, such a matter could define the nation for years to come."
bhutan.52.a:0 "All twenty members will be elected by the Gepos village leaders"
bhutan.52.b:0 "Each penlop and the Je Khenpo is afforded a representative, with ten elected counterparts"
bhutan.52.c:0 "The seats will be split between representatives of the penlops and the monasteries."

bhutan.53.t:0 "First Meeting of the National Assembly"
bhutan.53.d:0 "The new assembly has come together for one of their two annual meetings in Punakha. The assembly is made up of twenty members, each representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages. While in Punakha they drafted up a number of plans for their future meetings, and aim to begin formally advising the king at their next meeting. Their primary goal is to make the king aware of local problems which may otherwise be overlooked by the court."
bhutan.53.a:0 "The people have spoken"

bhutan.54.t:0 "First Meeting of the National Assembly"
bhutan.54.d:0 "The new assembly has come together for one of their two annual meetings in Punakha. The assembly is made up of twenty members, nine appointed by each of penlop governors, one representing the monasteries, and ten representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages. While in Punakha they drafted up a number of plans for their future meetings, and aim to begin formally advising the king at their next meeting. Their primary goals are to defend the interests of the penlop aristocrats and to make the king aware of local problems which may otherwise be overlooked by the court."
bhutan.54.a:0 "Truly an esteemed collection of advisers"

bhutan.55.t:0 "The National Assembly Radicalises"
bhutan.55.d:0 "In the last two meetings of the National Assembly, the body has drafted a number of advisory pieces for the king. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the Assembly Sonam Topgye has contended that a number of these proposals were far too radical, calling upon resources that the crown did not have, and disrupting the central planning that the Gongzim has long called for. In response to the increased antagonism between Sonam Topgye and the council, many members have begun advocating for more power to be given to the assembly, forming a new power block of radical reformers."
bhutan.55.a:0 "A dangerous new faction"

bhutan.56.t:0 "The National Assembly Stagnates"
bhutan.56.d:0 "The last two meetings of the National Assembly have been an exercise in futility. With some members representing conservative aristocrats, and others largely beholden to the serfs who toil under these lords, it has been hard to find common ground. Debates turn into shouting matches and little progress is made, all while members radicalise on either side."
bhutan.56.a:0 "Perhaps Bhutan is not ready for democracy"

bhutan.57.t:0 "Jigme Dorji takes the Reins of Government"
bhutan.57.d:0 "Having completed his education and proven himself as spirited and diligent, Jigme Dorji has been given a number of new powers, with regent Sonam Topgye Dorji returning to his role as the king’s first minister. While the king will still be largely reliant on his advisers and his court, he also incredibly independent, and seeks to begin his own program of societal reform."
bhutan.57.a:0 "May his reign be long and prosperous"

bhutan.58.t:0 "The King Falls Ill"
bhutan.58.d:0 "King Jigme has long suffered from bouts of weakness. The commonly held belief is that this ailment is the result of a curse. Legend tells of a spirit which inhabits the woods surrounding the summer Dzong, which cast this dark magic on the young Jigme as punishment for hunting without leaving the proper sacrifices. Ever since this incident Jigme has suffered under the curse, which would send him into fits of exhaustion. Recently, however, the king has been visited by a young Hindu doctor, who has presented an alternative diagnosis. He claims that the king is suffering from a heart condition. Many in court are outraged with this assertion, which calls into question the king’s health and belittles the power of woodland spirits."
bhutan.58.a:0 "Send this Hindu quack back!"
bhutan.58.b:0 "Perhaps we should heed his warnings"

bhutan.59.t:0 "The King Seeks Treatment"
bhutan.59.d:0 "In response to the worrying diagnosis of a Hindu doctor, Jigme has begun to patronize a number of men familiar with medicine and disease. He has begun a process of treatment for his condition, eating no meats and performing exercise recommended by these professionals. Whether these treatments will help the king is yet to be seen, though he has shed a few pounds in the process."
bhutan.59.a:0 "A healthy king is a healthy kingdom"

bhutan.60.t:0 "A Grand Archery Contest"
bhutan.60.d:0 "King Jigme has long been an avid archer, hosting a number of hunts and contests. This most recent endeavour has been his most ambitious by far, bringing archers from across Bhutan to perform against one another. While the competition has been fierce after days of strenuous sport, the victor was found on the end of the third day."
bhutan.60.a:0 "Let the greatest archer win!"
bhutan.60.b:0 "Let the greatest king win!"

bhutan.61.t:0 "The King’s New Horse"
bhutan.61.d:0 "Jigme has kept a number of royal horses in his years as king. Having been raised with horsemanship as one of the central pieces of his martial education, his love for riding has not diminished since his childhood. Thus, it has become well known that the gift of a horse, if one could afford it, could deliver a great degree of royal support. A minor noble recently arrived in the capital, bringing with him a beautiful gray Tibetan pony."
bhutan.61.a:0 "A gift fit for a king!"

bhutan.62.t:0 "The Grand Feast"
bhutan.62.d:0 "During his time as Penlop of Paro, Tshering Penjor was often the first Bhutanese leader to meet foreign visitors, who would pass through the active trading roads in the Paro valley to continue on to the capital. It was in this capacity that Tshering Penjor became known for his large feasts, entertaining guests with Black-Hat Mask Dances and tours of his estate. I was during this period that he became well known by British envoys, who lavished him with gifts and prestige, but referred to him by the derogatory name Sir Cumference. In the years following the collapse of British rule in India, the number of foreign travelers passing through Paro diminished greatly, but Tshering Penjor’s thirst for revelry did not diminish with it. With the Paro Tshechu festival months away, the hedonistic king has called for a celebration of the monarchy in the capital, with food, games, and events. Tshering Penjor believes that such a celebration will bring the kingdom together after the chaos of the last years."
bhutan.62.a:0 "There is much to celebrate!"

bhutan.63.t:0 "Traditionalist Disagreements"
bhutan.63.d:0 "The Traditionalist faction is based on a union between conservative monks and aristocratic military figures, who banded together to safeguard the kingdom from the influences of Sonam Topgye Dorji and his Reformist allies. While this arrangement has allowed these groups to take control of the country, divisions within the faction have begun to appear. Tshering Penjor falls firmly into the camp of military reformers, and has little regard for the whims of the monks. He is, however, willing to negotiate to maintain the stranglehold that the Traditionalists have over the country."
bhutan.63.a:0 "Increase the monastic commission"
bhutan.63.b:0 "Leave them be"

bhutan.64.t:0 "Factions Reconcile"
bhutan.64.d:0 "There was a brief period where it appeared that the religious conservatives in Bhutan would abandon the Traditionalist cause, but our fears turned out to be unjustified. After the Je Khenpo and the Zhung Dratshang we told of the concessions made by King Tshering Penjor to the Buddhist cause, dissident voices were silenced and order returned to the court."
bhutan.64.a:0 "Good"

bhutan.65.t:0 "Traditionalist Faction Splits"
bhutan.65.d:0 "Representatives of the Je Khenpo recently approached the king with a proposal to commission a new copy of the texts foundational to the Drukpa Lineage of Buddhism. While the king made it incredibly clear that the funds required for such a project would have to instead go to the creation of the Royal Army, the abbot was not pleased with the response. It was not long before many Traditionalist monastic leader began joining the representative in his condemnation, with some going as far as to leave the capital in disgust. Truly this seems to have been the straw that broke the camel’s back, with hundreds of once loyal allies turning their back to us."
bhutan.65.a:0 "At least they aren’t Reformists"

bhutan.66.t:0 "Zamadar Chencho Promoted"
bhutan.66.d:0 "Having long served as a loyal but unassuming military figure, Zamadar Chencho is a key part of the new initiatives for a modern military force. It is for these qualities that we have decided to made him Quartermaster of the new Royal Bhutan Army. In our nation, where resources are limited and each gun is valuable, having such a capable figure as Quartermaster will surely be a boon."
bhutan.66.a:0 "Now where did I put all those Patags?"

bhutan.67.t:0 "Education of the Heir"
bhutan.67.d:0 "With Jigme Dorji poised to assume the throne, the nature of his education could have wide reaching effects on the future of the kingdom. As of now Jigme Dorji has been schooled around the capital and in bordering India, with courtiers and tutors supplementing his basic education, and one of the great Lopen teachers providing him with the fundamentals of the Drukpa Buddhist lineage. The young king has approached his studies with enthusiasm, and he shows great promise as a prospective statesman. He stands now at an important pivoting point, his last years of schooling will surely colour his approach to ruling the nation"
bhutan.67.a:0 "He should finish his schooling in court"
bhutan.67.b:0 "Continue his education in India"
bhutan.67.c:0 "Let the generals tutor him"

bhutan.68.t:0 "Education of the King"
bhutan.68.d:0 "With Jigme Dorji poised to fully assume the responsibilities of the throne, the nature of his education could have wide reaching effects on the future of the kingdom. As of now Jigme Dorji has been schooled around the capital and in bordering India, with courtiers and tutors supplementing his basic education, and one of the great Lopen teachers providing him with the fundamentals of the Drukpa Buddhist lineage. The young king has approached his studies with enthusiasm, and he shows great promise as a prospective statesman. He stands now at an important pivoting point, his last years of schooling will surely colour his approach to ruling the nation."
bhutan.68.a:0 "He should finish his schooling in court"
bhutan.68.b:0 "Continue his education in India"
bhutan.68.c:0 "Try to bring in a European tutor"

bhutan.69.t:0 "Phasing out Serfdom"
bhutan.69.d:0 "Bhutanese society is structured as a traditional feudal hierarchy, with thousands of powerless serfs ruled over by a collection of aristocrats and lamas, along with their armies of bureaucrats. While these serfs are represented by Gewog village leaders, they have next to no rights, and are often abused by their suzerains. While the Traditionalists are contented to retain this cruel and outdated system of governance, men like Sonam Topgye Dorji have begun experimenting with a more liberal approach, freeing his personal peasantry from their traditional bondage and implementing a new system of taxation. His efforts have improved the quality of life in his fiefdom, and he claims that his new taxes will bring in an equal amount of revenue once his personal bureaucracy manages to properly implement them. Perhaps we should widen the scope of his experiment."
bhutan.69.a:0 "Sounds risky"
bhutan.69.b:0 "Free the king’s personal serfs"
bhutan.69.c:0 "Mandate these practices across the kingdom"

bhutan.70.t:0 "Liberalization Stagnates"
bhutan.70.d:0 "Though our campaign to eradicate serfdom was well intentioned, it has largely failed in the face of uncooperative officials and an apathetic populace. With the nobility unwilling to relinquish their traditional prerogatives, and villages given little incentive to fight for their newly-promised rights, very little has actually changed in Bhutan. Though the peasantry are no longer called serfs, they have gotten precious little aside from a new name."
bhutan.70.a:0 "Disappointing"

bhutan.71.t:0 "Poor Harvest"
bhutan.71.d:0 "In the country of Bhutan farming is deeply tied to Buddhist canon. The name for agriculture is sonam, the word for blessing, and any land is considered blessed if it is able to support any of the nine crops known as the dru-na-gu: rice, wheat, barley, peas, two kinds of buckwheat, millet, mustard, and soy beans. While good harvests are thus widely considered a gift from higher powers, a bad crop is taken by many to be a sign of discontent among spirits, or the reflection of a society which has lost its way. Regardless, the last harvest has fallen short of what was expected, with early frosts and poor conditions contributing to a meagre yield."
bhutan.71.a:0 "Let the local lords and Gewogs deal with this"
bhutan.71.b:0 "Cut back on the commodity tax for this year"
bhutan.71.c:0 "Perhaps if we introduced rice crops to the South?"

bhutan.72.t:0 "Disorganized Response"
bhutan.72.d:0 "Turning to local authorities to deal with the poor harvest has proven to be a blunder. While some areas suffer from food shortages, others continue to stockpile surplus cereals. The presence of royal tax collectors in the homes of struggling villagers tries the patience of even the most loyal subject, and public opinion is far from favourable. At the same time, those with grains and the wherewithal to traverse the countryside are becoming wealthy at the expense of the starving."
bhutan.72.a:0 "Oops"

bhutan.73.t:0 "New Rice Crops Harvested"
bhutan.73.d:0 "While rice has been one of the central crops in Bhutan since before the time of the first Zhabdrung, it could only be planted in certain regions of the country, at the banks of the rivers which carve the great valleys of Thimphu, Punakha, Trongsa, and Paro. In the lowlands of the south, tubers like yams and taros make up the bulk of the crop, with the climate considered unsuitable for rice paddies. However, at the behest of the Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji, the crop has been introduced to the region. Using a complex system of irrigation canals and new breeds of rice better suited to the climate, the experiment has largely worked, with a much larger crop available, and greater food security."
bhutan.73.a:0 "Fantastic!"

bhutan.74.t:0 "Agitator in the South"
bhutan.74.d:0 "It has come to our attention that a village leader has been openly criticizing our government. This Mandal, Pashupati Adhikari, is a member of the Lhotshampa minority, a group of Nepalese who migrated into Bhutan from their homelands in Nepal and Assam. His complaints are linked to the special land taxes levelled against these Lhotshampas, and his message is beginning to resonate with the other Lhotshampa villages. We have reason to believe that the root of this treasonous talk is the Gorkha League, a dangerous gang of Lhotshampa radicals who advocate Nepalese succession."
bhutan.74.a:0 "Best to leave him be"
bhutan.74.b:0 "Expel him and seize his property"
bhutan.74.c:0 "Eliminate this rabble rouser"

bhutan.75.t:0 "Trouble with the Lhotshampa"
bhutan.75.d:0 "The loyal servant of Sonam Topgye Dorji, Jhulendra Bahadur Pradhan, has come to the capital bearing bad news.  He reports that a number of Lhotshampa village leaders have begun to come into closer contact with the Gorkha League, complaining of discriminatory practices and looking for ways to resist the central government. While now is no time to solve the issue of the Lhotshampa, perhaps we should address this development before things get out of hand."
bhutan.75.a:0 "Let us form a more equal agreement"
bhutan.75.b:0 "Perhaps the taxes could be eased slightly"
bhutan.75.c:0 "Clamp down on these dissidents"

bhutan.76.t:0 "French Explorer Passes Through"
bhutan.76.d:0 "Recently our capital was visited by a small group of European explorers. Among them was Alexandra David-Neel, a Frenchwoman who has written extensively on her travels to Tibet. She is currently attempting to return to Lhasa with her husband, but fears that she will be turned away by the government there, so plans to travel incognito."
bhutan.76.a:0 "Safe travels Mrs. David-Neel!"

bhutan.77.t:0 "The Hunting Accident"
bhutan.77.d:0 "As he grows older, the young Jigme Dorji has shown great promise as a hunter, with admirable skill as an archery and horseman. His mentors, quite pleased with his skill and enthusiasm, commissioned a tiger hunt in the southern lowlands to test the mettle of Jigme Dorji. While the hunt began in high spirits, tragedy soon struck when Jigme Dorji was thrown from his horse unexpectedly, causing him minor injuries and ending the prospects of the hunt. The unsuccessful huntsman is now bedridden, and will be for some time to heal fully. Hopefully he will not die of boredom in the meantime."
bhutan.77.a:0 "Sorrow overtakes Jigme Dorji"
bhutan.77.b:0 "Oh well..."
